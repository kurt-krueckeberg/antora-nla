= Cover Note: Summary of Krückeberg's Petition to the Vormundschaftliche Kammer 
:page-role: wide

This appears to be a brief routing note that summarizes Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition to acquire land
adjacent to his garden. It likely served as a forwarding cover when the document was submitted to the
Vormundschaftliche Kammer, the princely fiscal authority responsible for managing domains, finances, and
inheritance matters in Schaumburg-Lippe.
