____
draft or copy prepared for internal records, usually a fair copy or clean copy made in the office before the final
signed version is issued.

In 18th–19th century German bureaucratic practice — especially in the Schaumburg-Lippe Cammer and _Amt_ records —
_Concept_ was used as a header for:

* The *office draft* of an outgoing document (often kept in the file for reference).

* Sometimes an *exact copy* of what was sent, written at the same time as the original.

* Distinct from _Original_ (the one with official seals sent to the recipient) and _Expedition_ (dispatch record).

So *"Concept Cammeral:Kaufbriefs"* means:

____
Draft of the Chamber’s purchase deed — i.e., the internal file copy of the official _Kaufbrief_ issued to formalize
the land purchase.
