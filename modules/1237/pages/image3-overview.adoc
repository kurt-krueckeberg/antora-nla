= Document 2: Land Assignment Report and Its Offical Response, 1799

== The Land Assignment Report

The "main text", the larger text on the page, is the *The Land Assignment Report* issued by the
*Ämter Bückeburg und Arensburg* (local adminstrative offices of Bückeburg and Arenburg). They are reporting to the
*Gräflich vormundschaftliche Cammer* (Countly Guardianship Chamber), which was the higher fiscal and administrative
authority for land and estate matters. 

The report describes:

* The request from *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*, a _Brinksitzer_ (smallholder) residing at No. 10 in Berenbusch, to
obtain a piece of land to enlarge his garden and farmyard.

* A local objection raised by a *Köter* (an older term for a small cottager with minimal land rights; see sidebar)
named *Weiland*, also from Berenbusch. 

=== Its Official Response

The *marginal note*, the darker, somewhat smaller text on the left, is a response to the remitted report, but not a
formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction, filed with the main document for reference and action.
It is a reaction from the higher office (the Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).

* Instructing the local officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.
