== Narrative Overview — Document 6

=== Final Transfer of Ownership (December 1, 1800)

Document 6, titled *Concept Cammeral:Kaufbriefs*, is the final instrument in the case.  
It serves *in place of a formal, sealed deed of sale* (*Kaufbrief*) and officially transfers ownership of the purchased parcels to **Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg, No. 10 in Berenbusch**, and his heirs.

Following Krückeberg’s petition (Document 1) and the subsequent approvals and conditions set forth in earlier Rescripts and reports (Documents 2–5), the **Comital Guardianship Treasury Office** (*Gräflich vormundschaftliche Rentkammer*) confirms:

* Two parcels on the village street were *formally assigned and sold* to Krückeberg for the *enlargement of his
garden and courtyard*.
* The parcels had been measured by a sworn land surveyor:
** Garden expansion — *19 rods 44 feet (decimal)*
** Courtyard area — *1 rod 90 feet (decimal)*
* The purchase price, calculated at *24 Mariengroschen per square rod*, was paid in full:
** *14 Reichsthaler, 8 Mariengroschen, 1 Pfennig* to the Comital Treasury.
* Krückeberg assumes responsibility for *annual ground rent (Rottzins)*, contributions, and both ordinary and
extraordinary levies, to be entered in the *Amt* Bückeburg’s accounts on schedule.
* The document assures Krückeberg and his heirs that their possession of the parcels will be *legally protected
against all parties*.

The document is dated *Bückeburg, December 1800*, and issued under the *impressed comital guardianship treasury
seal* with signatures of the appointed directors and councillors: **Gladbeck, von Landesberg, Maas, Windt, and
Wippermann**.  It was dispatched by **Beÿer**.
