== Transfer of Ownership – Krückeberg, Berenbusch (December 1800)

Document 6 is the formal *Cammeral Purchase Deed* (*Cammeral:Kaufbrief*) issued by the Vormundschaftliche
Rentkammer in Bückeburg to **Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg**, tenant farmer of holding No. 10 in Berenbusch.  

It finalizes a process that began with his petition for additional land (Document 1, dated 1799) and proceeded
through approval and assignment stages (Documents 4 and 5, both dated October 1800).  

The deed confirms the lawful transfer of **two plots** — one adjoining his garden and the other his farmyard —
which had been **surveyed on 30 March 1799** by an official land surveyor. The measurements were:  

* Garden enlargement: *19 rods 44 feet*  Farmyard enlargement: *1 rod 90 feet*  

These plots had been provisionally allocated in earlier Cammer correspondence and were approved in Rescript No.
D:322 of **27 October 1800** (Document 5).  

The deed states that Krückeberg has **paid the agreed purchase price** of *14 Reichsthaler, 8 Mariengroschen, and 1
Pfennig* to the comital treasury, calculated at *24 Mariengroschen per square rod*.  

It also specifies his ongoing obligations: to pay the assessed *Rottzins* (ground rent) starting from **Michaelmas,
29 September 1800**, as well as all ordinary and extraordinary dues, to be rendered annually to the Bückeburg Amt.  

Issued in **December 1800**, the document serves *in place of a formal notarized purchase deed*, bearing the
**printed comital Rentkammer seal** and the **customary signatures of the Director and Councillors** of the
Vormundschaftliche Rentkammer. It guarantees that Krückeberg and his heirs will be protected in their ownership and
enjoyment of the land in perpetuity.
