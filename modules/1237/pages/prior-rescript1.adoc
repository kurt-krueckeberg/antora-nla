Regarding No. D: 322, as noted above
Draft: Cammer directive
To the officials in Bückeburg

                Very Gracious Lords,
                
                In reply to your report dated the 18th
                of this month concerning the land
                set aside for the farmer Krückeberg, No. 10
                in Berenbusch, for the purpose of enlarging
                his farmyard and garden—specifically, a total
                area of 19 rods and 44 feet plus 1 rod and 90
                feet.
                
                This land is to be subject, starting from Michaelmas
                (29 September) of this year, to an annual ground
                rent of 2 Mariengroschen and 1 Pfennig.
                
                We hereby confirm without reservation:
                
Cap: per Bolte. 

                That we approve the assignment of this land to
                him under the same terms and conditions already
                communicated to you in Our official order dated
                11 March 1799, and we also approve the proposed
                annual ground rent.
                
                You are to ensure that Farmer Krückeberg fulfills
                all the conditions you have no doubt already made
                known to him.
                
                He is now required to pay the set purchase price at
                a rate of 2 Reichsthaler and 4 Mariengroschen per rod,
                totaling an amount of 14 Reichsthaler, 8 Mariengroschen,
                and 1 Pfennig. This payment is to be made to Our revenue
                office.
                
                We remain,
                Bückeburg, 27 October 1800
                On behalf of the Count
                          
                                               Mkaas
                                             Wint
