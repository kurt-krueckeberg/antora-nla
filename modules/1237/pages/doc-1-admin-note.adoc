It was a later archival or administrative note, added after the original Forestry 
Report (the main body of text). Its purpose was to record that the document was
physically handed over to the relevant office for inclusion in Beilage 18
("Appendix 18") of some official report. It served as a sort of disposition
record — an internal note for filing and tracking.
