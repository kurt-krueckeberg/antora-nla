location in the forest, for each poplar to be felled,
to plant three sapling poles in return.

Nr:: *Nummer* (Number), usually refers to the registry number of the file or document.
Cam: Nr: 662:: Archival reference number. "Cam:" abbreviates *Cammer* (old spelling of *Kammer*), meaning the fiscal or administrative office. "Nr: 662" is the filing number used internally by that office to track this specific case.
