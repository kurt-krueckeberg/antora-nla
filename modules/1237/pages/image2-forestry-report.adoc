Chamber: No. 662.                          No. 1.
Chamber rescript:

regarding the forestry office report.     presented: 30 May 1798.
Received: 14 June 1798
            MK

The requested plot lies
on the village street of
Berenbusch. It is
a small
corner that can be
designated
without any disadvantage. — The poplar trees standing on it
would then be sold by the forestry office,
and Krückeberg would be obliged
to commit himself at another
location in the forest, for each poplar to be felled,
to plant three sapling poles in return.
                                  Maas, forestry official

== Definitions

[.glossary]
dreÿ:: Archaic form of *drei* (three). The long "ÿ" was often used for stylistic reasons, especially in handwritten formal texts.
Papplen:: Variant spelling of *Pappeln* (poplars), with double "p" and "l" — not corrected in transcription.
Maas:: Likely the surname of the forestry official, signed in an ornate hand at the bottom.

== Notes

This transcription preserves original spelling, punctuation, and spacing as found in the 1798 manuscript. No modernizations have been applied.
