= Forestry Office Report
:page-role: wide

Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg likely submitted his petition in person to the Amt (local office) in Bückeburg on or
before 29 May 1798. We know this because the xref:image1.doc[Document Index] records May 29, 1798, as the date of
the "Petition of tenant farmer Krückeberg No. 10 in Berenbusch".

It is very likely that someone in the Amt formally composed or transcribed Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition
onto official paper.  The Amt also compiled a brief Forestry report onto the same official paper and forwarded the
document to the Cammer (central fiscal authority). The Cammer received and registered the document on 30 May 1798,
assigning it an internal registry number “Cam: Nr: 662” and classifying it as a rescript (“Res Cam”). These labels
were written in the upper-left corner by the Cammer as part of its document tracking process. The one-day
discrepancy between 29 May (document dated by the Amt) and 30 May (date of presentation at the Cammer) simply
reflects this administrative transfer.

NOTE: In this image, only the forestry report is present. The text to its right and below it, visible in the

[.glossary]
dreÿ:: Archaic form of *drei* (three). The long "ÿ" was often used for stylistic reasons, especially in handwritten formal texts.
Papplen:: Variant spelling of *Pappeln* (poplars), with double "p" and "l" — not corrected in transcription.
Maas:: Likely the surname of the forestry official, signed in an ornate hand at the bottom.
