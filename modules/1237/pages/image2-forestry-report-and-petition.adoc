= Document 1: Petition and Forestry Office Assessment Regarding Land Expansion (29–30 May 1798) 
:page-role: wide

Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg likely submitted his request in person to the Amt (local office) in Bückeburg on or
before 29 May 1798. We know this because the xref:image1.adoc[Document Index] records May 29, 1798, as the date of
the "Petition of tenant farmer Krückeberg No. 10 in Berenbusch".

A clerk named Lindemann formally composed or transcribed Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition onto official paper.
The Amt also compiled a brief Forestry Report onto the same official paper and forwarded the document to the Cammer
(central fiscal authority). The phrase *"praes: 30. May 1798"* (short for praesentiert, presented) was written by
the Amt to indicate the date the document was formally forwarded or submitted to the Cammer.

The Cammer (also located in Bückeburg) officially registered the document on 14 June 1798 (*B. 14. Jun. 1798*),
assigning it the internal reference number *“Cam: Nr: 662”* and marking it as *“Res Cam”*, meaning it was formally
filed and entered into the chamber’s registry for further handling.

These labels were written in the upper-left corner by the Cammer as part of its document tracking process.
The one-day discrepancy between 29 May (when the petition was composed or recorded at the Amt) and 30 May (when it
was formally forwarded to the Cammer) reflects the administrative sequence of submission and transfer—not
necessarily when it was received or reviewed by the Cammer.

== Jobst Heinrich's Request

Jobst Heinrich's request is the smaller text found on the Forestry Department's Report. The salution of his request
is addressed to the ruling nobility of Schaumbug-Lippe and appears to the right of the text by the Forestry Department.
The request itself begins below the Forestry Department Report and continues on the backside of the page where
it concludes.

=== Salutation

The text below (in grayscale mode) appears to the right of the main text of the forestry report
and is written much smaller. It is a formal salutation addressed to the reigning Fürstin (princess,
female ruler) and possibly a Count, who is the recepient of written request that appears below the
forestry report.

=== Petition Body

The request itself appears below the forestry report. Notice these expressions:

* “Nahe an *meinem* Garten …” (Close to my garden)
* “… so wünschte *ich* dieselbe gern urbar zu machen …” (I would like to bring it under cultivation)
* “… an *mich* zu bringen.” (to acquire it for myself)

It is clearly a first-person petition rather than a administrative note by the Amt (office,
department).

The petition requests:

* To purchase (käuflich zu überlassen) the corner of land (jene Ecke) for a fair price (einen billigen Preis).
* For the land to be inspected (baldigst besichtigen) and measured (ausmessen).
* Concludes with a formulaic expression of respect to the ruling authorities (Ewr. Durchlauchten und Ewr. Hochgräflichen Gnaden).

The body of the petition begins on the first page of document 1, but it continues on its backside:

Durchlauchtigste Fürstin!

Gnädigst Regierende Fürstin und Frau

Hochgeborner Graf!

Gnädigst Regierender Graf und Herr

Nahe an meinen Garten bragt auf der Gemein-
heit beÿ der Straße eine schiebe Ecke Landes
die unbebauet ist und mithin auch niemand
einen Nutzen verschafft, wodurch über dem noch die
Straße unegal wird.  Da dieselbe nun nahe
an meinen Garten stößt, so wünschte ich diesel-
be gern urbar zu machen und käuflich an mich
zu bringen. An Ewr. Durchlauchten und Ewr.
Hochgräflichen Gnaden ergehet daher meine
unterthänigst bitte:

Mir jene Ecke gnädigst für
einen billigen Preis käuflich zu
überlassen und dieselbe deßhalb
baldigst besichtigen und ausmessen
zu lassen.

In tiefster Ehrfurcht verharre ich

Most Serene Princess!
Most Gracious Ruling Princess and Lady
High-born Count!
Most Gracious Ruling Count and Lord.

Close to my garden, on the common land by the
road, there lies a sloping corner of land
which is uncultivated and therefore of no use to
anyone, and which even causes the road to be uneven.
Since this corner adjoins my garden, I would like
to cultivate it and purchase it.

I therefore respectfully present this petition
to your serene highness and your high comital grace.

I most humbly request that the corner of land
be most graciously sold to me for a fair price,
and that it therefore be inspected as soon as
possible and measured for this purpose.

With deepest respect, I remain before
Your Serene Highness and
Your High Comital Grace.

== Endorsement of the Petition 

This brief note appears at the bottom of Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition
to the authorities. It confirms that the petition was submitted in Bückeburg on
May 29, 1798, and was written not by Krückeberg himself, but by a scribe or
clerk named Lindemann, likely employed by the chancery or local administration.
The phrase "pro St." is shorthand for pro Statu, meaning “by order” or “on
behalf [of the authority].” It implies that Lindemann drafted the petition
officially or in accordance with administrative procedure. The note concludes
with “unterschriebner” (signed) and identifies Krückeberg by name and house
number, serving as a formal signature or attestation. The handwriting and
format strongly suggest that Krückeberg dictated or authorized the petition
rather than writing it personally.

== Adminstrative Note

This handwritten note appears along the bottom left edge of the page. It was written
vertically but has been rotated horizontally below to make it easier to read:

It was a later archival or administrative note whose purpose was to record that
the document was physically handed over to the relevant office for inclusion in
Beilage 18 ("Appendix 18") of some official report. It served as a sort of disposition
record — an internal note for filing and tracking.
