= Document 1: Petition and Forestry Office Assessment Regarding Land Expansion (Document 1, 29–30 May 1798) 
:page-role: wide

Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg likely submitted his petition in person to the Amt (local office) in Bückeburg on or
before 29 May 1798. We know this because the xref:image1.adoc[Document Index] records May 29, 1798, as the date of
the "Petition of tenant farmer Krückeberg No. 10 in Berenbusch".

It is very likely that someone in the Amt formally composed or transcribed Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition
onto official paper, and that Jobst Heinrich did not write it himself. The Amt also compiled a brief Forestry Report
onto the same official paper and forwarded the document to the Cammer (central fiscal authority). The phrase
*"praes: 30. May 1798"* (short for praesentiert, presented) was written by the Amt to indicate the date the
document was formally forwarded or submitted to the Cammer.

The Cammer (also located in Bückeburg) officially registered the document on 14 June 1798 (*B. 14. Jun. 1798*),
assigning it the internal reference number *“Cam: Nr: 662”* and marking it as *“Res Cam”*, meaning it was formally
filed and entered into the chamber’s registry for further handling.

These labels were written in the upper-left corner by the Cammer as part of its document tracking process.
The one-day discrepancy between 29 May (when the petition was composed or recorded at the Amt) and 30 May (when it
was formally forwarded to the Cammer) reflects the administrative sequence of submission and transfer—not
necessarily when it was received or reviewed by the Cammer.

== Jobst Heinrich's Request

Jobst Heinrich's written request is the smaller text found on the Forestry Department's Report.
The salution of his request is to the right of the text of the Forestry Department. The request itself
is below the Forestry Department Report.

=== Salutation

The text below appears to the right of the main text of the forestry report
and is written much smaller. It is a formal salutation addressed to the reigning
Fürstin (princess, female ruler) and possibly a Count, who is the recepient of
written request that appears below the forestry report.

=== Request

The request itself appears below the forestry report. Based on its content
and style, it was almost certainly written by or on behalf of Jobst Heinrcih Krückeberg
(or dictated by him and written in his name). Notice these expressions:

* “Nahe an *meinem* Garten …” (Close to my garden)
* “… so wünschte *ich* dieselbe gern urbar zu machen …” (I would like to bring it under cultivation)
* “… an *mich* zu bringen.” (to acquire it for myself)

Itis clearly a first-person petition rather than administrative note by the Amt (office,
department).

Durchlauchtigste Fürstin!

Gnädigst Regierende Fürstin und Frau

Hochgeborner Graf!

Gnädigst Regierender Graf und Herr

Nahe an meinen Garten bragt auf der Gemein-

die unbebauet ist und mithin auch niemand
einen Nutzen verschafft, wodurch über dem noch die
Straße unegal wird.
Da dieselbe nun nahe
an meinen Garten stößt, so wünschte ich diesel-
be gern urbar zu machen und käuflich an mich
zu bringen.

An Ewr. Durchlauchten

Ewr. Hochgräflichen Gnaden
ergehet daher meine

most serene princess!

most gracious ruling princess and lady

highborn count!

most gracious ruling count and lord

close to my garden, on the common land
by the road, there lies a sloping corner of land
which is uncultivated and therefore of no use to anyone,
and which even causes the road to be uneven.
since this corner adjoins my garden,
i would like to cultivate it and purchase it.

i therefore respectfully present this petition
to your serene highness
and
your high comital grace.

== Adminstrative Note

This handwritten note appears along the bottom left edge of the page. It was written
vertically but has been rotated horizontally below to make it easier to read:

It was a later archival or administrative note whose purpose was to record that
the document was physically handed over to the relevant office for inclusion in
Beilage 18 ("Appendix 18") of some official report. It served as a sort of disposition
record — an internal note for filing and tracking.

== Glossary of Terms

=== Glossary of Terms in Forestry Report

Res Cam.:: Abbreviation for *Rescriptum Cammerale* or *Resolution Cammeralis*, meaning “Chamber Resolution” or “Chancellery Response.” A common header or reference for official documents in 18th–19th century administrative usage.
Brevi manu:: Latin phrase meaning “by hand” or “summarily.” In bureaucratic contexts, it indicated that a document was physically delivered, often without formal correspondence.
dem Amts:: Dative case of *das Amt*, meaning “to the office” or “to the authorities.”
zum Berichte:: “For the report.” Indicates the document was submitted to be included in or referenced in an official report.
B. 18°:: Abbreviation for *Beilage 18*, meaning “Appendix” or “Enclosure 18.” The ° symbol is a historical shorthand often used for ordinal or enumerative reference.
Febr:: Abbreviation for *Februar* (February).
Maas:: Likely the surname or signature of the person submitting or certifying the note.


=== Glossary of Terms in Petition

Durchlauchtigste:: Superlative ceremonial title: *“Most Serene”* (literally “most transparent/illustrious,” from *durchleuchten* = to shine through). Used for high-ranking princes/princesses of the Empire. Feminine superlative form here (ending *-ste*).

Fürstin:: Princess (female ruler or the consort of a *Fürst*). Rank below a king/queen but sovereign or mediatized territorial ruler within the Holy Roman Empire and successor states.

Gnädigst:: “Most gracious.” Intensified form of *gnädig* (“gracious, merciful”). Very common in formal addresses to princes, counts, and other high nobles; functions as a deferential honorific rather than a literal comment on kindness.

Regierende / Regierender:: “Ruling,” “reigning,” i.e., exercising governmental authority (as opposed to merely titular). Spelling in period documents may vary (*Regierende*, *Regirende*); gender and case endings change with the noun (here: *Fürstin* vs *Graf*).

Frau:: Literally “woman” or “wife,” but in formal address “Lady.” In princely salutations, “und Frau” = “and Lady,” marking respect for her person and/or consort status.

Hochgeborner:: “Highborn.” A noble style traditionally used when addressing counts (*Grafen*) and certain other ranks. Masculine form shown here.

Graf:: Count. A hereditary noble rank; in many German territories an important territorial lord beneath princely rank.

Herr:: “Lord,” “Sir,” depending on context and rank. In high-noble address formulas, “und Herr” reinforces deference to the person’s seigneurial or jurisdictional authority.

Ewr. Durchlauchten:: Abbreviation of *Eurer Durchlaucht*, meaning “Your Serene Highness,” a title for princes or princesses.

Ewr. Hochgräflichen Gnaden:: “Your High Comital Grace,” an honorific address for counts or countesses.

urbar machen:: “To bring under cultivation,” referring to making unused land arable.

Schiebe Ecke::  means a wedge-shaped or sloping corner of land.

unegal:: means uneven or irregular in shape, possibly referring to the street's alignment.

=== Terms in Forestry Report

Res Cam:: Abbreviation for "Rescriptum Cammerae" (Latin), meaning “Filed by the Cammer” or “Registered by the Chamber.”
Papplen:: Variant spelling of *Pappeln* (poplars), with double "p" and "l" — not corrected in transcription.
Maas:: Likely the surname of the forestry official, signed in an ornate hand at the bottom.
