= = Petition and Forestry Office Assessment Regarding Land Expansion (Document 1, 29–30 May 1798) 
:page-role: wide

Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg likely submitted his petition in person to the Amt (local office) in Bückeburg on or
before 29 May 1798. We know this because the xref:image1.doc[Document Index] records May 29, 1798, as the date of
the "Petition of tenant farmer Krückeberg No. 10 in Berenbusch".

It is very likely that someone in the Amt formally composed or transcribed Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition
onto official paper, and that Jobst Heinrich did not write it himself. The Amt also compiled a brief Forestry Report
onto the same official paper and forwarded the document to the Cammer (central fiscal authority). The phrase
*"praes: 30. May 1798"* (short for praesentiert, presented) was written by the Amt to indicate the date the
document was formally forwarded or submitted to the Cammer.

The Cammer (also located in Bückeburg) officially registered the document on 14 June 1798 (*B. 14. Jun. 1798*),
assigning it the internal reference number *“Cam: Nr: 662”* and marking it as *“Res Cam”*, meaning it was formally
filed and entered into the chamber’s registry for further handling.

These labels were written in the upper-left corner by the Cammer as part of its document tracking process.
The one-day discrepancy between 29 May (when the petition was composed or recorded at the Amt) and 30 May (when it
was formally forwarded to the Cammer) reflects the administrative sequence of submission and transfer—not
necessarily when it was received or reviewed by the Cammer.

NOTE: In this image, only the forestry report is present. The petition text to its right and below it, visible in the
xref:image2-intro.adoc[complete image], has been removed.
