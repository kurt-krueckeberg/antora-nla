kind of higher-level civil authority—combining:
+
** estate management
** guardianship over minors and wards of the state
** fiscal oversight
** and responsibility for legal and property matters not handled by local offices (Ämter).

== Left Side Text

* *"Res Cam"* - is short for *“Rescriptum Cammerale”* or *“Rescript Cammer[al]”* . It refers to a *rescript* (a
formal written response or decree) from the *Cammer* (the ruling fiscal or administrative body — in this case, the
Vormundschaftliche Kammer in Bückeburg. In Document 1, the label ‘Res Cam’ appears to indicate that the Cammer’s
directive or approval was issued directly on the document itself.
