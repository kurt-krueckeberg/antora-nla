== Right Side Text

* *"Nr:1"* in the upper right desiginates it as doucment number 1.
* *"praes: 30. May 1798."* -- "praes:" is short for praesentiert (presented). May 30, 1798, was the date document 1
was presented to (reviewed by) the *Vormundlichte Cammer*, the guardianship chamber, a higher, state-level authority.
+
In smaller German principalities like Schaumburg-Lippe, the *Vormundschaftliche Cammer* typically functioned as a
kind of higher-level civil authority—combining:
+
** estate management
** guardianship over minors and wards of the state
** fiscal oversight
** and responsibility for legal and property matters not handled by local offices (Ämter).

== Left Side Text

* *"Res Cam"* - is short for *“Rescriptum Cammerale”* or *“Rescript Cammer[al]”* . It refers to a *rescript* (a
formal written response or decree) from the *Cammer* (the ruling fiscal or administrative body — in this case, the
Vormundschaftliche Kammer in Bückeburg. 
+
In Document 1, “Res Cam” likely does not mean that this specific document is the Cammer's directive. Instead, it means:
