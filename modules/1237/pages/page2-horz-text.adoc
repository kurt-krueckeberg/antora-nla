=== Meaning
This note can be translated as:

*"Chamber Rescript. Summarily sent to the office for a report, the 18th of February 1799. (Signed) Maas."*

**Explanation:**
- *Res: Cam.* indicates that this is an official rescript or directive issued by the Cammer (Chamber/Chancellery).
- *Brevi manu* (Latin for "by a short hand") means that this was done briefly, without lengthy procedure — essentially a short-form order or instruction.
- *zum Berichte* means “to the office for the purpose of a report,” indicating that the matter was forwarded to the Amt for an official opinion or update.
- *D. 18.* abbreviates *den 18.* (the 18th day), a dating convention used in administrative documents.
- *Maas* is the signature of the official who issued or noted this instruction.

Brevi manu:: Latin phrase meaning "summarily," "briefly," or "without lengthy procedure." Often used for short, direct orders.

Amte:: The dative singular of *Amt* (office, administrative district) in its older form with the now-archaic "-e" ending. Historically, many German nouns took a dative singular "-e" in formal and literary language, e.g., *im Hause* (modern: *im Haus*), *zu Tische* (modern: *zu Tisch*), and *dem Amte* (modern: *dem Amt*).

zum Berichte:: German for "for the report," meaning it was sent to the office to prepare or provide a report.

D. 18.:: Abbreviation of *den 18.* (the 18th day), a common dating convention in older German administrative documents.

Febr. 1799:: Abbreviation for "Februar 1799" — February 1799.
