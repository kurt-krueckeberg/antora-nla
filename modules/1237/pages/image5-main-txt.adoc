To No. Chamber 53. S. S.                     3
Draft of chamber rescript
to the officials in Bückeburg

                            V. G. G.
                            We have resolved, based on your
                            report submitted on the 27th of
                            February of this year, that the
                            Brücksitzer Krückeberg, No. 10,
                            in Berenbusch be assigned the
                            requested plot located on the
                            village street there next to his
                            garden for its enlargement,
                            under the condition
                            that the willows and poplars
                            currently on the site be sold

                            and that Colon Krückeberg be

                            the planting of three saplings
                            for every poplar or willow tree
                            to be felled.
                            You are therefore to inform him

|===
| Line
| Meaning

| `ad nr: Cam: 53. S. S.`
| Filing reference: This rescript belongs to *Chamber case no. 53*, under the filing or subject category "S. S."

| `Concept Cammer: Rescript`
| This is a *draft decree* (rescript) originating from the *Cammer* (chamber office), likely concerning land, property, or forestry matters.

| `an die Beamten zu Buckeburg`
| Addressee: the civil officials stationed in *Bückeburg*, who are responsible for executing or communicating the contents of the rescript.
|===

[role="section-narrow"]
=== Glossary of Terms

ad nr:: Latin abbreviation for *ad numerum*, meaning "to the number." Used in file routing and administrative referencing. It indicates the document concerns or belongs to a case or entry listed under a specific file number.

Cam:: Abbreviation of *Cammer* (or *Kammer* in modern German), meaning the **chamber**, referring to the *Cammeralbehörde* (chamber office or finance office) in charge of managing land, taxation, forestry, and estate matters. "Cam: 53." indicates this document relates to file number 53 in the chamber's records.

S. S.:: The meaning is uncertain but is almost certainly an administrative abbreviation. Both characters are uppercase and followed by periods. Possibly stands for:
* *Sub Signatur*, *Supplementum*, or *Special-Sachen* (special matters),
* or an internal filing code used to denote subcategories within a Cammer file.
The ambiguity in the style of the first "S" (it differs from the second) is likely due to the handwriting style, not semantic difference.

Concept Cammer: Rescript:: Indicates this is a **conceptual draft (Concept)** of a **rescript** (a formal written reply or decree) issued by the **Cammer** (chamber office). Rescripts were typically responses to petitions or reports sent up from local offices.

an die Beamten zu Buckeburg:: "To the officials in Bückeburg." This line completes the heading: it is a **draft rescript from the Cammer**, addressed **to the civil officials of Bückeburg**. These officials were tasked with carrying out and communicating the decision.

Espp: Schwarze:: A marginal or side notation, identifying the **scribe**, **secretary**, or possibly the **reviewing official**. "Espp:" is most likely an abbreviation of *Especiert* (meaning: "specified by") or a shorthand scribe initial. **Schwarze** is a surname. This note is written at the left margin and indicates authorship, approval, or secretarial involvement.

‡solchergestalt:: The word "solchergestalt" means "in such a manner" or "in this form." It serves as a **discourse marker** that introduces a condition or framework that has just been described. The double dagger (‡) appears both in the margin and in the body of the text:
* It serves as a **visual reference mark**, directing the reader from a marginal note (or side instruction) into the point in the text where it applies.
* In this document, it emphasizes the section that contains the **financial obligation** (payment of 24 Mariengroschen per square Rute for the land being assigned).

Quadrat: Rute:: A **square rod** or **square perch**, a historical unit of area (1 Rute ≈ 3.77 meters, so a square Rute ≈ 14.2 m²). The tenant was charged 24 Mariengroschen per Quadrat-Rute of newly assigned garden land.

Colon:: A term for a peasant farmer with hereditary rights to a plot of land (Latin origin: *colonus*). In Schaumburg-Lippe, "Colon" designated a full-status rural landholder, as opposed to lesser holders like a Köter.

Brücksitzer:: A type of rural settler — possibly someone whose house adjoins a bridge (*Brück*) or a minor landholding class.

d. J.:: Abbreviation for *dieses Jahres*, meaning “of this year.” Common dating shorthand.

Unserstatteten:: Archaic spelling for *unserstatteten*, a past participle meaning “submitted to us” (i.e., the report previously sent to the Chamber).

resolvirt:: Archaic spelling of *resolvieren* (resolved, decided).

Setzstangen:: Young saplings or planting poles. The term appears in forestry regulations. Here, Krückeberg is obligated to plant **three new saplings** for each willow or poplar tree removed.

Forstdepartement:: The **forestry department** responsible for managing tree cutting, planting obligations, and land-use rules related to woodland and timber.

Mariengroschen:: A coin denomination used in various North German states in the 18th–19th centuries. Twenty-four Mariengroschen = financial compensation for each Quadrat-Rute assigned to Krückeberg.

überlaßenden:: Archaic form of *überlassenden* (being transferred or granted).
