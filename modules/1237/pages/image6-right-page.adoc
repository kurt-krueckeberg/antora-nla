= Document 4: Submission of Geometric Drawing of Proposed Parcels to be Allocated (Oct 18,1800)
:page-role: wide

Document No. 4 (numbered "4" in the upper-right corner) is a formal report from the Ämter Bückeburg and Arensburg
to the Vormundschaftliche Kammer, proposing that Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg be granted two parcels of land. This
document states:

[quote]
____
„Indem wir die geometrische Zeichnung … übersenden…“
(“As we submit the geometric drawing…”)
____

This indicates that the drawing was sent together with that report — that is, it was enclosed with Document 4.

Document No. 4½ (numbered "4½" in the upper-right corner) contains that very drawing, signed by Lieutenant Funck,
a sworn surveyor. It is described in the Document Index as:

[quote]
____
„dazu gehöriger Bericht von Lieutenant Funck“
(“associated report by Lieutenant Funck”)
____

This means it is supplementary (“dazu gehörig”) to the preceding document — i.e., an enclosure to Document 4.
