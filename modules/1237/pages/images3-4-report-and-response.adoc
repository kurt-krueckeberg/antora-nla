//:page-role: wide

== Land Assignment Report

This is the Land Assigment Report issued by the issued by the *Ämter Bückeburg und Arensburg* (local
adminstrative offices of Bückeburg and Arenburg). They are reporting to the *Gräflich vormundschaftliche
Cammer* (Countly Guardianship Chamber), which was the higher fiscal and administrative authority for
land and estate matters. It was sent along with the personal petition of Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg.

The response to their report was also written on the left side of this report; however, in this image,
in the image below it has been removed to improve the readability of the report. The response folows
follows late below.

=== Land Assignment Report: Key Points

* The request from *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*, a _Brinksitzer_ (smallholder) residing at No. 10 in Berenbusch, to obtain a piece of land to enlarge his garden and farmyard.

* A local objection raised by a *Köter* (an older term for a small cottager with minimal land rights; see glossary)
named *Weiland*, also from Berenbusch, who:
** Expressed dissatisfaction with the planned assignment.
** Claimed he himself wanted to acquire the same plot.
** Argued the land reassignment would restrict his access for transporting crops.

* An assurance from the local authorities (the Ämter Bückeburg and Arensburg) that this access issue would be
examined more closely during the land survey (_Ausmeßung_), but initial assessment suggested the objection had no
valid basis.

* _Additional finding_: The actual cause of Weiland’s objection seemed to be that he had *illegally planted willow
trees* (_Weiden Bäumen_) on the plot in question—i.e. he had already started using it without authorization.

* Final judgment: Since the planting had been done *without permission* (_eigenmächtiger Weise_), this act did not
constitute a legal claim to the land, and there were *no legitimate grounds* to deny Krückeberg’s requested
assignment.

Land Assignment Report for Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg, March 6, 1799  
Chamber No. 53  
2 1.  
Forestry Matters  

To  
Guardianship Chamber  
Report  
of the Offices of Bückeburg and  
Arensburg.  

Re:  
Land Assignment  

Attached we remit the petition of the smallholder Jobst  
Henr[ich] Krückeberg No. 10 in Beren-  
busch along with the report that among  
the residents of the villages  
Berenbusch, Nordholz, and Evesen  
only the very well-to-do  
Köter (tenant smallholder) Weiland of Berenbusch  
has expressed dissatisfaction about the  
proposed assignment,  
since on the one hand he himself  
wishes to obtain this plot,  
and on the other hand claims that  
his access route for transporting his  
harvests would be overly restricted.  

We will assess this more closely  
during the surveying process and  
be of the opinion that regarding the  
access route no legitimate  
objection remains.  

In particular, what prompted his  
objection is the planting  
of this plot with willow trees,  
which he had undertaken on his own  
initiative. However, this  
does not constitute  
a valid reason to refuse  
the requested assignment.

== Official Response to Petition and Land Assignment Report

The *marginal note* in the image is a response to the remitted xref:image3-land-assignment-report[Land
Assignment Report], but not a formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction,
filed with the main document for reference and action. It is a reaction from the higher office (the
Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).  Instructing the local
* officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.

It was written in the left margin the Land Assignment Report and encroaches on its text. To aid readability, the
text of the Land Assigment Report has been erased from the imaage.

____
The plot is therefore to be allocated, and since various residents in
Berenbusch are said to have enlarged their gardens on their own authority, the
officials are to obtain further information about this and report accordingly.

=== Glossary of Terms and Archaic Spellings

*Vormundschaftliche Kammer*:: Literally "Guardianship Chamber", but in the context of early modern German
principalities like Schaumburg-Lippe, this refers to a fiscal-administrative authority operating under a regency or
in the absence of a ruling count. It handled official matters such as land sales, rents, taxation, and resource
management. It did not primarily concern itself with the guardianship of individuals, but rather served as the
ruling administrative body.

*remittiren*:: An older spelling of *remittieren*, meaning to submit, transmit, or refer officially. In this
administrative context, it means to formally send a report or petition from a lower authority (like a local Amt) to
a higher authority (like the Vormundschaftliche Kammer) for decision or approval.

*Betr.*:: Abbreviation for *Betreff*, meaning "subject" or "regarding." Commonly used in official documents to
indicate the topic or reference line.

*Ausweisung*:: Allotment or designation of land, often used in administrative or land management contexts.

*beurtheilen*:: Archaic spelling of *beurteilen*, meaning "to judge" or "to assess".

*Cammer*:: Archaic form of *Kammer*, meaning "chamber" or "department", often used in historical administrative
contexts such as *Rentkammer* (revenue chamber).

*Erbtheil*:: Archaic compound of *Erbteil*, meaning "inheritance share". *Theil* is the older spelling of *Teil*
("part").

*Früchte*:: Literally "fruits", in this context referring to harvested crops or produce.

*Köter*:: Not a given name but a social designation in rural contexts; refers to a cottager or smallholder (German:
*Kötter*). It was sometimes used before the person's name.

*Platz*:: A plot or parcel of land.

*Rottzins*:: A type of feudal land rent (often a quit-rent) payable by tenants for cleared land (*Rodung* =
clearing).

*sehn*:: Likely an archaic or regional variant spelling of *sein* ("to be"). In this context, the verb *dahin sein*
is part of a periphrastic construction implying intent or obligation (e.g., "to make sure" or "to ensure"). It is
almost certainly a Kurrentschrift “h” in the image, and the meaning is parallel to *sein*, not *sehen* ("to see").

*Theil*:: Archaic form of *Teil*, meaning "part" or "portion". Common in 18th–19th century German.

*Vormundschaftlich(e)*:: Pertaining to guardianship, used in administrative contexts (e.g., *vormundschaftliche
Kammer* = "guardianship chamber", i.e., a noble fiscal or estate authority acting on behalf of a minor or estate).

*Weg zur Einfahrt*:: The route or access path for bringing in goods (e.g., agricultural produce).

*Bepflanzung*:: Planting or cultivation of vegetation, usually in a specific area. In this context, refers to the
unauthorized planting of willow trees on the disputed land.

*Weiden Bäume*:: Willow trees. Willow planting may have been used to indicate land use or claim over a piece of
ground.

*eigenmächtiger Weise*:: Unlawfully or without official permission. Literally, “in an arbitrary or unauthorized
manner.”

*deferire*:: (Latin) “to defer to” or “to grant.” Used in formal decisions, often meaning “to comply with” or “to
yield to a request.” Here, the phrase *nicht zu deferire stehe mögte* implies that the authorities found no
obligation to defer to the objection.

*nicht vor der Art ist*:: A somewhat archaic legal phrase meaning “is not of the kind” or “not of the nature” that
would justify a specific action (here, denying the land assignment).

*vorzüglich*:: Especially, particularly. Used to emphasize a specific cause or detail (e.g., “vorzüglich veranlaßt”
= “especially caused by”).
