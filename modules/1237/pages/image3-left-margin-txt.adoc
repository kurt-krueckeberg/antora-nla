== Commentary

This margin note—dated 10 March 1799 and marked “Res Cam” (Rescript from the Cammer)—is a directive likely written
in response to the Amtsbericht (Report of the Local Offices) dated 27 February 1799. In that report, the local
authorities acknowledged that a resident named Weiland had raised concerns over a parcel of land being allocated to
Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg. The Cammer now issues a follow-up instruction indicating that the parcel in question
(“der Platz”) has been allocated (“ausgewiesen”), but that other residents of Berenbusch may have previously
expanded their gardens without authorization. The Cammer instructs the local officials (“die Beamten”) to gather
more specific information about this situation and report back.

This margin note helps us understand that the Cammer was monitoring patterns of land use and was concerned not only
with this individual petition but with broader trends of unauthorized property expansion.
