=== Glossary of Terms

Colonus::
  A tenant farmer or hereditary leaseholder. In 18th–19th century German documents, "Colon" or "Colonus" was a formal title, not a personal name.

Ruthe (plural: Ruthen)::
  A historical German unit of length or area. As a unit of area, 1 square Ruthe varied by region, but was typically between 3.5 and 4 square meters. In this context, it likely refers to square Ruthen.

Fuß::
  German for “foot” (plural: Füße). A traditional unit of length, slightly shorter than the modern foot — usually around 28–30 cm depending on locale.

decimal::
  Refers to the **decimalized portion of a Ruthen or Fuß**, used to express fractional values in land measurements. Example: “44 feet decimal” indicates a base unit plus fractional precision.

Funck::
  The surname of the sworn surveyor who authored and signed the measurement report. Likely a local land surveyor or geometer active in Bückeburg around 1799.

beeidigter Landmesser::
  Sworn surveyor — an officially appointed and sworn-in land measurer responsible for producing certified land plans and records.

Graben zur Ableitung des Wassers::
  "Ditch for water drainage" — a feature marked on the sketch, indicating land engineering for managing surface water.

Communic. Weg::
  Abbreviation for *Communicationsweg*, meaning "communal path" or shared roadway. A route accessible by multiple parties, often between properties.

Plan zur Vergrößerung des Hofraums und Gartens::
  “Plan for the enlargement of the yard space and garden” — the title under the sketch, summarizing its purpose.

Verbindung::
  Connection or linkage — used to describe how figure *b* connects to figure *a* in the layout.
