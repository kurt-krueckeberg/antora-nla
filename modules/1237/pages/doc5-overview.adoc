== 18 October 1800 – Local Officials' Report

The Ämter Bückeburg and Arensburg submitted a report to the Vormundschaftliche Cammer regarding the proposed
allocation of additional land to **Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg**, tenant farmer (Colon) No. 10 in Berenbusch.  The
land—two adjoining plots totaling **21 rods, 34 feet**—was to enlarge his farmyard and garden.  

They proposed an annual *Rottzins* (ground rent) of **2 Mariengroschen, 1 Pfennig**, beginning *Michaelmas* (29
September) 1800, and a purchase price of **2 Reichsthaler, 4 Mariengroschen per rod**.

== 27 October 1800 – Rescript 1: Approval of Land Assignment
The Cammer replied in its first Rescript (*ad nr. D: 322. S.S.*), formally approving:
* The allocation of the two plots under the same terms set out in the Cammer’s earlier order of **11 March 1799**.
* The proposed *Rottzins* of 2 Mariengroschen, 1 Pfennig annually.
* The fixed purchase price totaling **14 Reichsthaler, 8 Mariengroschen, 1 Pfennig**, payable to the Cammer’s
revenue office.

The local officials were instructed to ensure Krückeberg fulfilled all stated conditions.

== 27 October 1800 – Rescript 2: Directive to Collect Purchase Price

In a second Rescript on the same day, addressed to **Cammer Rentmaster Stackmann**, the Cammer ordered:

* Collection of the purchase price from Krückeberg for the newly assigned plots, calculated at 24 Mariengroschen
per rod (total 14 Reichsthaler, 8 Mariengroschen, 1 Pfennig).
* Entry of the amount under the proper heading in the Cammer accounts.
* Use of the Rescript itself as the official accounting justification.

The marginal note *Exp: per Bolte* records that the order was dispatched by the official Bolte.

== Significance

These two Rescripts represent the **final administrative stage** of the case:
. **Rescript 1** – the Cammer’s formal approval of the land assignment.
. **Rescript 2** – the instruction to collect and record payment.

With these actions, the land enlargement for Krückeberg moved from **proposal to final execution**.

**TODO: FIX**
