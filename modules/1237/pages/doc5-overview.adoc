== Composition of the Document Explained

This document consists of a single unified entry dated 27 October 1800. It begins with a *Cammeral Rescript*
addressed to the officials in Bückeburg, authorizing the allocation of land to Colon Krückeberg Nr. 10 in
Berenbusch and approving the associated terms of use and payment. The Rescript is signed by Cammer officials Waag
and Wintz.

The document continues—without a new document number—on the opposite page with a *Cammer Anweisung* (instruction or
directive) to the Cammerwontmeister and Rentmeister Stackmann. This directive authorizes him to collect the purchase
price of 14 Rthlr. 8 mgl. 1 d. for the designated land and to record it in the Cammer accounts. This portion is
signed by a different set of officials involved in fiscal execution.

There is no indication that this is a separate document: it shares the same date, refers to the same land parcel
and purchase amount, and carries no new document identifier. Therefore, it is correctly listed in the Document
Index as a single document (Document No. 5).
