= Document 4½: Surveyor's Drawing of Two Parcels (March 30, 1799)

Why does the survey predate the main report by over a year?

The Lieutenant Funck survey drawing (30 March 1799) almost certainly predates the bureaucratic decision process.
Here’s a likely reconstruction:

[arabic,start=1]
. *March 1799* – Funck produces the survey and measurement for the proposed land allocation.
. The survey is probably submitted informally or to a lower-level office (Forstamt / local Amt) and used as reference
during negotiations, inspections, and back-and-forth between offices.
. *Many months pass* while the Cammer and the Amt correspond with each other, possibly because other matters delayed
the approval (including the legal terms for payment and rent).
. *18 October 1800* – The officials produce Document 4 (“Bericht von denselben Beamten”), the formal _official
report_ to
the Cammer — now attaching Funck’s old survey as supporting material.
. When the file is assembled for archiving, the clerk indexes Document 4, then inserts the earlier survey drawing
right after it, labeling it “4½” to preserve the logical grouping in the file, even though the date is earlier.
