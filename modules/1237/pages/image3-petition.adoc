== Endorsement of the Petition 

This brief endorsement identifies the petitioner — Colon Krückeberg of house
number 10 in Berenbusch — and confirms that the petition was submitted by
Lindemann acting on his behalf. The abbreviation “geh.” (short for “gehörig” or
“gegenwärtig”) indicates that Lindemann is formally representing Krückeberg in
this matter. The abbreviation “pro St.” is short for *pro Supplicante* (Latin),
meaning “on behalf of the supplicant.” Such endorsements were common in 18th-
and early 19th-century administrative practice when formal petitions were
delivered by representatives or clerks.
