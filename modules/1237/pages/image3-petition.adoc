== Endorsement of the Petition 

This brief note appears at the bottom of Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition
to the authorities. It confirms that the petition was submitted in Bückeburg on
May 29, 1798, and was written not by Krückeberg himself, but by a scribe or
clerk named Lindemann, likely employed by the chancery or local administration.
The phrase "pro St." is shorthand for pro Statu, meaning “by order” or “on
behalf [of the authority].” It implies that Lindemann drafted the petition
officially or in accordance with administrative procedure. The note concludes
with “unterschriebner” (signed) and identifies Krückeberg by name and house
number, serving as a formal signature or attestation. The handwriting and
format strongly suggest that Krückeberg dictated or authorized the petition
rather than writing it personally.
