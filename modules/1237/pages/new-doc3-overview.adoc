=== Recapitulation: Cammer Reaction to Document 2 (10 March 1799)

After first reviewing Document 2 on March 6, 1799, the Cammer noted, on March 10, 1799, their intention to approve
Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg's request and to assign land to him for purchase, pending formal conditions.

=== Official Directive (11 March 1799) from Cammer to Ämter

On March 11, 1799, the official reply of the Vormundschaftliche Cammer to the Ämter (offices) of Bückeburg and
Arensburg was written. The header references (*"S.S"* in the upper left, meaning *supra scripta* — “as noted
above”*) the case file denoted by *"Cam:53"*, which is Document 2.

In this rescript, the Cammer grants **conditional approval** for the allocation of the requested plot to
Krückeberg, No. 10, Berenbusch, under the following terms:

* The willows and poplars on the plot are to be sold by the forestry department.
* Krückeberg must plant three saplings at another designated forest location for each willow or poplar removed.
* He must pay 24 Mariengroschen per square rod for the plot.

If Krückeberg agrees to these terms, the Amt is instructed to:

* Have the plot surveyed by a sworn surveyor in the presence of Forester Talkmann.
* Ensure that access for Colon Weiland, No. 1, is maintained.
* Report the final measured size back to the Cammer.
