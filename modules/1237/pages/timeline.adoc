= Timeline of Events in the Case File of Colon Krückeberg (No. 10, Berenbusch)

== The Actors

Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg::
 A tenant farmer dwelling at No. 10 Berenbusch, living near a forest, who wants to enlarge his farmyard and garden.

Weiland of Berenbusch::
Who expresses dissatisfaction with the planned assignment, claimed he himself wanted to acquire the same plot, and
argued the land reassignment would restrict his access for transporting crops.

Fürstin::
Princess, female ruler (of Schaumburg-Lippe)

Graf::
Graf is German for Count, thus the Count of Schaumburg-Lippe

Lieutenant Funck::
A *sworn land surveyor* who will measure two parcels of ground and who drawing and report will supplement
document #4.

Amt::  
The *Amt* is where Jobst Heinrich made is request. The *Amt* was the *local or regional administrative office*
responsible for executing the instructions of the Cammer. It handled *field investigations, reports, local
enforcement, and petitions*, and submitted findings to the Cammer. The Amt had no final authority but provided the
*practical groundwork* for the Cammer’s decisions.  In the case file, officials of the Amt Bückeburg & Arensburg
surveyed land and submitted reports on Krückeberg's request.

Cammer (Kammer)::  
The *Cammer* was the central governmental authority responsible for *fiscal administration, land management, taxation, forestry, and state property*.  
It operated at the principality level and issued binding *Rescripte* (official decisions).  
Its seat was typically in Bückeburg and it oversaw the activities of regional offices (Ämter).  
In the case file concerning Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg, the Cammer was the body that made the *final decisions* on land grants.

=== Document 1: Step-by-Step Evolution and Workflow

==== ✅ Confirmed Sequence of Events

1. **29 May 1798 – Petition Written by the Amt**
+
Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg appears at the Amt in Bückeburg. Lindemann, an official there, transcribes Krückeberg’s
request to purchase adjacent plots of land for garden and farmyard expansion. This handwritten petition forms the
original basis of Document 1.

2. **30 May 1798 – Petition Presented to the Vormundschaftliche Cammer**
+
The petition is submitted to the Cammer. The header "praes: 30 May 1798" is entered on the document, indicating the
date of presentation to the Cammer. This marks the beginning of Cammer-level processing.

3. **14 June 1798 – Forestry Office Assessment Added**
+
The Cammer consults the Forestry Office for an evaluation of the land request. The forestry official MKaas writes
an assessment directly onto the petition. This assessment is dated "B. 14. Jun. 1798" and signed "MKaas Forstamt."
It becomes the large body of text on the left side of Document 1.

4. **18 February 1799 – Document Hand-Delivered Back to the Amt**
+
A marginal note, written vertically on the petition page, reads:
+
[verse]
____
Res Cam. Brevi manu dem  
Amts zum Berichte. B. 18  
Febr 1799   MKaas  
____
+
This indicates that the Cammer’s directive (Res Cam.) was physically returned ("brevi manu") to the Amt to obtain
their formal written report.

5. **After 18 Feb 1799 – Amt Bückeburg and Arensburg Compose Document 2**
+
In response to the Cammer’s directive, the two Aemter draft Document 2. This document includes:
+
* A cover report addressed to the Cammer
* A statement that the original petition is enclosed again
* A summary of public opinion—only one objection is raised (by the Köter Weiland in Berenbusch)

==== 🧩 Conclusion

Document 1 evolved from a single petition into a composite case document containing both the petition and the
official assessment. It was sent back and forth between the Amt and the Cammer, gaining administrative annotations
and directives along the way. This explains the layered handwriting and content from multiple officials.
