= Timeline of Events in the Case File of Colon Krückeberg (No. 10, Berenbusch)

NOTE: This timeline is not yet complete. It needs to be revised.

It takes a year and half until a decision is made on Jobst Heinrich's request to enlarge his garden and farmyard.
During this time, two governmental bodies, the *Cammer* and the *Amt*, interact. Six documents are generated.

== Difference Between the Cammer and the Amt

The following explanation clarifies the roles of the *Cammer* (Kammer) and the *Amt* in the 18th–19th century administration of Schaumburg-Lippe:

[glossary]
Cammer (Kammer)::  
The *Cammer* was the central governmental authority responsible for *fiscal administration, land management, taxation, forestry, and state property*.  
It operated at the principality level and issued binding *Rescripte* (official decisions).  
Its seat was typically in Bückeburg and it oversaw the activities of regional offices (Ämter).  
In the case file concerning Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg, the Cammer was the body that made the *final decisions* on land grants.

Amt::  
The *Amt* was the *local or regional administrative office* responsible for executing the instructions of the Cammer.  
It handled *field investigations, reports, local enforcement, and petitions*, and submitted findings to the Cammer.  
The Amt had no final authority but provided the *practical groundwork* for the Cammer’s decisions.  
In the case file, officials of the Amt Bückeburg & Arensburg surveyed land and submitted reports on Krückeberg's request.

|Date
|Event / Document
|Significance

|29 May 1798
|*Petition (Vorstellung)* of Colon Krückeberg No. 10, Berenbusch +
(Designatio Actorum No. 1)
|Krückeberg submits a request to expand his farmyard and garden. The petition is likely composed by or with the assistance of the Amt(administrative office).

|30 May 1798
|*praes:* Entry on Document Nr. 1 (Forstamt opinion)
|Indicates the date on which the petition and its attached documents were formally *presented* (praesentiert) to the Cammer.

|14 June 1798
|*B.* Entry on Document Nr. 1
|Means "Berichtet" (recorded). The Cammer officially logs the Forstamt’s assessment. It becomes *Cam: Nr. 662* in the Cammer registry.

|May–June 1798
|*Forstamt assessment* by Officer Maas
|Concludes that the plot can be allocated “without any disadvantage” and describes conditions for tree replacement. This report is later considered Document Nr. 1 in the ACTA.

|18 February 1799
|*Administrative marginal note* written vertically on Document Nr. 1 +
[Res Cam. Brevi manu dem Amts zum Berichte. B. 18° Febr 1799. Maas]
|After months of inaction, the Cammer reactivates the file. It quickly sends the matter to the Amt *“brevi manu”* — informally — for a report. This is a procedural nudge to resume the stalled process.

|27 February 1799
|*Report from the Bückeburg Amt* +
(Document Index No. 2)
|The Amt responds to the Cammer, providing additional details or confirmation of the earlier assessment.

|11 March 1800
|*Draft Chamber Instruction* to the Amt +
(Document Index No. 3)
|The Cammer drafts instructions, likely directing the Amt to proceed with the necessary arrangements (surveying, documentation, etc.).

|18 October 1800
|*Follow-up Report by Amt* +
(Document Index No. 4)
|Further status report, perhaps in response to the March instruction. Indicates ongoing administrative steps.

|[Undated, c. Oct 1800]
|*Report by Lieutenant Funck* (Surveyor) +
(Document Index No. 4½)
|Surveyor confirms boundaries and prepares a map. Confirms plot dimensions and placement. This is likely the basis for the land assignment and official land record entry.

|27 October 1800
|*Draft Instructions* to both the Amt and Cammer Treasurer Barkmann +
(Document Index No. 5)
|Prepares the final administrative steps and financial coordination for transfer or purchase.

|1 December 1800
|*Draft Purchase Letter (Kaufbrief)* +
