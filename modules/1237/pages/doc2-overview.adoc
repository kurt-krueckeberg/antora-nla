== Recapitulation: Cammer sends Forestry Office Assessment to Ämter (February 18, 1799)

After the Cammer reviewed Krückeberg's petition (Document 1), on May 30, 1799, they commissioned a Forestry Office
assessment, which was drafted onto Document 1 on February 27, 1799. It concluded the enlargement of Krückeberg's
garden and farmyard would have no detimental impact. Some poplars would need to be removed and sold by the forestry
office, and Krückeberg would be obligated to replant three saplings in another area of the forest as replacements.

But it was not until February 18, 1799, though, that the Cammer returned Document 1 to the Ämter (offices) of
Bückeburg and Arensberg.

== The Land Assignment Report (27 Feb 1799)

With the new guidance from the Cammer, the Ämter prepared Document 2, on March, 1799, to inform the Cammer that they had
reviewed the forestry report, and that locally only one Berenbusch resident named Weiland raised objections —
which the Ämter dismissed as without merit.

The "main text", the larger text on the page, is the *The Land Assignment Report* issued by the *Ämter Bückeburg
und Arensburg* (local adminstrative offices of Bückeburg and Arenburg).

=== Cammer's Reactiion (10 Mar 1799)

The *marginal note*, the darker, somewhat smaller text on the left, is the Cammer's response to the remitted
report, but not a formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction, filed with the main document
for reference and action.  It is a reaction from the higher office (the Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).

* Instructing the local officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.
