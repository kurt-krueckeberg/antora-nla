== The Land Assignment Report

Document 2 is a formal report submitted jointly by the local administrative offices (Ämter) of Bückeburg and
Arensburg to the Vormundschaftliche Cammer. It serves as the official response to a petition originally submitted
by tenant farmer Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg, Nr. 10 in Berenbusch, who had requested permission to purchase adjacent
land to enlarge his garden and farmyard.

The petition (Document 1) was initially submitted to the Cammer at the end of May 1798, then supplemented with a
Forestry Office assessment in June 1798. After reviewing these materials, the Cammer issued a directive that the
Aemter provide a formal statement addressing the petition’s implications and any local concerns.

Document 2 is the result of that directive. It begins with a brief cover report to the Cammer, identifying the
matter as a forestry-related case and referencing the attached petition (remitted "in der Anlage"). The Aemter
report that among the residents of Berenbusch, Nordholz, and Evesen, only one objection had been raised—by a
wealthy "Köter" (smallholder) in Berenbusch name *Weiland*. This man objected both because he wished to obtain the
land himself and because he feared it might obstruct his access route for transporting crops.

The tone of the report emphasizes that this is a solitary objection and implies that no significant opposition
exists among the broader population. The Aemter thus present the Krückeberg petition as reasonable and largely
uncontroversial at the local level.

This document plays a pivotal role in confirming that the proposed land assignment was acceptable to local
authorities and residents. It also reinforces the practice of thorough administrative review in Schaumburg-Lippe:
one in which petitions moved through multiple layers of evaluation—local, forestry, and state-level—before any
final resolution was issued.


=== Cammer's Official Response

The "main text", the larger text on the page, is the *The Land Assignment Report* issued by the *Ämter Bückeburg
und Arensburg* (local adminstrative offices of Bückeburg and Arenburg).

The *marginal note*, the darker, somewhat smaller text on the left, is a response to the remitted report, but not a
formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction, filed with the main document for reference and
action.  It is a reaction from the higher office (the Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).

* Instructing the local officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.
