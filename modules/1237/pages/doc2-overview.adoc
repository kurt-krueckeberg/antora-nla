== The Land Assignment Report

Document 2 is a formal report submitted jointly by the local administrative offices (Ämter) of Bückeburg and
Arensburg to the Vormundschaftliche Cammer. It responds not merely to the original petition by tenant farmer Jobst
Heinrich Krückeberg, Nr. 10 in Berenbusch, but to the Cammer’s preliminary actions upon receiving that petition.

After Krückeberg's petition was submitted to the Cammer at the end of May 1798, the Cammer commissioned a Forestry
Office assessment to determine whether the proposed garden and farmyard expansion would negatively impact public
land or forest resources. The assessment concluded that the land could be granted with minimal concern, provided
that Krückeberg replant three saplings for each tree removed. This assessment was added to the petition sheet and
returned to the Aemter in February 1799, via hand delivery.

With this guidance in hand, the Aemter prepared Document 2 in March 1799 to inform the Cammer that they had
reviewed the petition and the forestry report, and that local sentiment was broadly favorable. Only one villager, a
Brink resident named Weiland, raised objections — which the Aemter dismissed as self-serving and lacking merit.

It begins with a brief cover report to the Cammer, identifying the matter as a forestry-related case and
referencing the attached petition (remitted "in der Anlage"). The Aemter report that among the residents of
Berenbusch, Nordholz, and Evesen, only one objection had been raised—by a wealthy "Köter" (smallholder) in
Berenbusch name *Weiland*. This man objected both because he wished to obtain the land himself and because he
feared it might obstruct his access route for transporting crops.

The tone of the report emphasizes that this is a solitary objection and implies that no significant opposition
exists among the broader population. The Aemter thus present the Krückeberg petition as reasonable and largely
uncontroversial at the local level.

=== Cammer's Official Response

The "main text", the larger text on the page, is the *The Land Assignment Report* issued by the *Ämter Bückeburg
und Arensburg* (local adminstrative offices of Bückeburg and Arenburg).

The *marginal note*, the darker, somewhat smaller text on the left, is a response to the remitted report, but not a
formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction, filed with the main document for reference and
action.  It is a reaction from the higher office (the Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).

* Instructing the local officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.
