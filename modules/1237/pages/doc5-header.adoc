= Document 5 Header
:page-role: wide

Document 5's header tells us it is the Vormundschaftliche Cammer's official reply to Document 4, which 
contained the submission of the geometric drawings of the parcels to be prospectively allocated to Jobst
Heinrich Krückeberg along with the Ämters recommendation that Jobst Heinrich "be assigned this land."

When Document 4 was sent to the Cammer, they xref:doc4-header.adoc[registered it] as "Cam: Nr. 322 Forstsachen (
Cammer No. 322 Forestry Matters)." When they sent Docment 5, their official reply, they linked it back to
Document 4 by writing "ad mr. D: 322. S.S. (Regarding case D:322, as above)" in the upper left corner. 

The *"Cam: Nr:"* form is used when the Cammer registers a new case in its subject index. The *"ad nr. … S.S."*
form is used when the Cammer or one of its offices sends or drafts a follow-up, which needs to be placed under
the same file number but is not the initiating document.

== Breakdown of Header Terms

* *ad nr.* — “to (or concerning) number …” — This is a _cross-reference marker_, showing that this document is to be
linked with a previously registered file number.
* *D:* — The letter “D” is almost certainly an internal series letter (likely for a particular sub-register or dossier
classification in the Cammer’s system — e.g., D for “Domänen- und Forstsachen” or a particular section of the
Vormundschaftliche Cammer’s registry).
* 322 — This is the _shared registry number_	 for the case file.
* *S.S. — In Cammer documents, this often means _supra scripta_ (Latin: “written above”), indicating “as previously
recorded / as above” — pointing to the main file entry where the matter was first logged.

Putting this all together, "ad nr. D: 322 S.S." means something like: “To (or concerning) case D:322, as above.” It
signals to the reader that this document continues the businsess of the existing case file document 322 in the "D"
series.
