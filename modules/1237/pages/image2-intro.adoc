== Overview

Page two has multiple sections of text written by different individuals. The large text, the main text, is the recording of the
proceedings of the Amt. To the right of it, written in a smaller hand, are what look to be expressions of salutation or formal
address, written as if to choose which to use, address to the Graf (count). Finally below the record of the proceedings are the
words of Colon Kr√ºckeberg.

Each area of text was extracted and a separate image of it created.
