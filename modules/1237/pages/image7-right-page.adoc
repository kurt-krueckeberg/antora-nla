= Reminder Note Regarding Chamber Directive on Berenbusch Woodland Boundaries (1800)
:page-role: wide

This text is a brief note regarding the previous documenmt that was sent and also referencing yet another document.
This can be seen from the contextual clues:

* **"Auch wäre an den Inhalt…"**
+
_"It should also be recalled…"_
+
This is a common bureaucratic phrasing used to refer back to a previous document or instruction.

* **"des Kam. Rescripts dd 15 April 1799"**
+
_"of the Chamber rescript dated 15 April 1799"_
+
An explicit reference to a previously issued decision or directive. This is likely the document being “recalled” in the line above.

* **"wie ad Nro. 317"**
+
_"as with No. 317"_
+
A cross-reference to another case or communication, suggesting that the current note should be understood in the same context or handled in the same manner as document No. 317.

* **"ad Nro. 322"**
+
_"regarding No. 322"_
+
Indicates that this marginal note or reminder is filed under dossier No. 322 — the same number as the main report seen in the previous image.

=== Glossary of Terms

Befriedigung:: In historical land administration, this refers to the "enclosure" or "fencing-in" of land—often to
delineate property boundaries or to protect cultivated areas. It can also imply the legal securing or defining of
property rights through physical demarcation.

Ausrückung:: Literally "setting out" or "staking out." In this context, it refers to the act of marking or laying
out the boundaries—typically by surveyors or forestry officials. It denotes the physical demarcation of parcels of
land or forest edges.

Angrenzer:: Adjacent landholder or neighbor. Specifically, "Wald-Angrenzer" refers to the properties or landowners
that border the forest—those whose land abuts woodland areas.

Cam. Rescript (Res Cam):: Abbreviation of Cammer-Rescript. An official directive or ruling issued by the fiscal
authority (Cammer). In English, often rendered as “Chamber Directive” or “Chamber Instruction.”

dd:: Abbreviation of Latin de dato, meaning "dated." Used to indicate that a document bears a specific date.

B. (as in "B. 27. Octbr"):: Abbreviation of "Berichtet" or "Bearbeitet" (Reported or Processed). Indicates the
administrative date when the document or note was entered or logged by the office.
