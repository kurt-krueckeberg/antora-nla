This text is a brief note regarding the previous documenmt that was sent and also referencing yet another document.
This can be seen from the contextual clues:

* **"Auch wäre an den Inhalt…"**
+
_"It should also be recalled…"_
+
This is a common bureaucratic phrasing used to refer back to a previous document or instruction.

* **"des Kam. Rescripts dd 15 April 1799"**
+
_"of the Chamber rescript dated 15 April 1799"_
+
An explicit reference to a previously issued decision or directive. This is likely the document being “recalled” in the line above.

* **"wie ad Nro. 317"**
+
_"as with No. 317"_
+
A cross-reference to another case or communication, suggesting that the current note should be understood in the same context or handled in the same manner as document No. 317.

* **"ad Nro. 322"**
+
_"regarding No. 322"_
+
Indicates that this marginal note or reminder is filed under dossier No. 322 — the same number as the main report seen in the previous image.
