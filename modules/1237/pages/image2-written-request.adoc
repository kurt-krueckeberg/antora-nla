== Overview

Jobst Heinrich's written request is the smaller text found on the Forestry Department's Report:

== Salutation

The text below appears to the right of the main text of the forestry report
and is written much smaller. It is a formal salutation addressed to the reigning
Fürstin (princess, female ruler) and possibly a Count, who is the recepient of
written request that appears below the forestry report.

== Request

The request itself appears below the forestry report. Based on its content
and style, it was almost certainly written by or on behalf of Jobst Heinrcih Krückeberg
(or dictated by him and written in his name). Notice these expressions:

* “Nahe an *meinem* Garten …” (Close to my garden)
* “… so wünschte *ich* dieselbe gern urbar zu machen …” (I would like to bring it under cultivation)
* “… an *mich* zu bringen.” (to acquire it for myself)

Itis clearly a first-person petition rather than administrative note by the Amt (office,
department).

Durchlauchtigste Fürstin!

Gnädigst Regierende Fürstin und Frau

Hochgeborner Graf!

Gnädigst Regierender Graf und Herr

Nahe an meinen Garten bragt auf der Gemein-
heit beÿ der Straße eine schiebe Ecke Landes
die unbebauet ist und mithin auch niemand
einen Nutzen verschafft, wodurch über dem noch die
Straße unegal wird.
Da dieselbe nun nahe
an meinen Garten stößt, so wünschte ich diesel-
be gern urbar zu machen und käuflich an mich
zu bringen.

An Ewr. Durchlauchten
und
Ewr. Hochgräflichen Gnaden
ergehet daher meine
Bitte.

most serene princess!

most gracious ruling princess and lady

highborn count!

most gracious ruling count and lord

close to my garden, on the common land
by the road, there lies a sloping corner of land
which is uncultivated and therefore of no use to anyone,
and which even causes the road to be uneven.
since this corner adjoins my garden,
i would like to cultivate it and purchase it.

i therefore respectfully present this petition
to your serene highness
and
your high comital grace.

== Glossary

Durchlauchtigste:: Superlative ceremonial title: *“Most Serene”* (literally “most transparent/illustrious,” from *durchleuchten* = to shine through). Used for high-ranking princes/princesses of the Empire. Feminine superlative form here (ending *-ste*).

Fürstin:: Princess (female ruler or the consort of a *Fürst*). Rank below a king/queen but sovereign or mediatized territorial ruler within the Holy Roman Empire and successor states.

Gnädigst:: “Most gracious.” Intensified form of *gnädig* (“gracious, merciful”). Very common in formal addresses to princes, counts, and other high nobles; functions as a deferential honorific rather than a literal comment on kindness.

Regierende / Regierender:: “Ruling,” “reigning,” i.e., exercising governmental authority (as opposed to merely titular). Spelling in period documents may vary (*Regierende*, *Regirende*); gender and case endings change with the noun (here: *Fürstin* vs *Graf*).

Frau:: Literally “woman” or “wife,” but in formal address “Lady.” In princely salutations, “und Frau” = “and Lady,” marking respect for her person and/or consort status.

Hochgeborner:: “Highborn.” A noble style traditionally used when addressing counts (*Grafen*) and certain other ranks. Masculine form shown here.

Graf:: Count. A hereditary noble rank; in many German territories an important territorial lord beneath princely rank.

Herr:: “Lord,” “Sir,” depending on context and rank. In high-noble address formulas, “und Herr” reinforces deference to the person’s seigneurial or jurisdictional authority.

Ewr. Durchlauchten:: Abbreviation of *Eurer Durchlaucht*, meaning “Your Serene Highness,” a title for princes or princesses.

Ewr. Hochgräflichen Gnaden:: “Your High Comital Grace,” an honorific address for counts or countesses.

urbar machen:: “To bring under cultivation,” referring to making unused land arable.

Schiebe Ecke::  means a wedge-shaped or sloping corner of land.

unegal:: means uneven or irregular in shape, possibly referring to the street's alignment.
