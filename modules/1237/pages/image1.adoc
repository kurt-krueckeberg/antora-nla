== What this table means in the context of the Case File

The Vormundschaftliche Cammer (or its successor office) maintained and archived the case file, including the original incoming documents from the Amt, the Cammer’s own responses, and any appended material.

This table serves as a *document index*, compiled by the Vormundschaftliche Cammer, which maintained and archived
the case file, including the original incoming documents from the Amt, the Cammer’s own responses, and any appended
material. The Vormundschaftliche Cammer (guardianship Chamber) was the higher, state-level, decision-making body.
In smaller German principalities like Schaumburg-Lippe, the *Vormundschaftliche Cammer* typically functioned as a
kind of higher-level civil authority—combining:
+
** estate management
** guardianship over minors and wards of the state
** fiscal oversight
** and responsibility for legal and property matters not handled by local offices (Ämter).

Each row in the table corresponds to a specific item (such as a petition, report, or land survey), and the columns
identify:

* *the document number*
* *a brief description of the document’s contents or subject*
* *the office that authored or handled the document*
* *the date it was created (year, month, and day)*

The column labeled *"Designatio Actorum"* — Latin for *description of the acts or documents* — provides a short
summary of each document's content.

By reading this table, a clerk at the time (or a modern researcher) could quickly understand the *structure and
contents of the case file* without having to examine every page in full.

== Glossary of Terms

Designation Actorum:: Latin for *"record of proceedings"* or *"designation of the records"*. More loosely: *"list of proceedings"* or *"index of entries"*.

d.d.:: *De dato*, Latin for *"of the date"* or *"dated."*. This means the document itself bears a date.

desfallsiger:: Means *"pertinent"* or *"relating to the matter."*  
  Breakdown of the word:  
  desfallsig = an adjective formed from:  
  - *des Falles* – *"of the case"* (genitive of *der Fall*)  
  - *-ig* – a common adjectival suffix  
  → So *"desfallsiger Bericht"* literally means *"report concerning this case"* or *"pertinent report."*

Cammer::
  Historical term for the administrative and fiscal office of a principality or territory. In this context, the
Cammer (also spelled Kammer) was responsible for land tenure, taxation, leases, and internal regulation. Often
translated as *Chamber* or *Fiscal Office* in English.

Cammer Rescript::
  An official written directive or instruction issued by the Cammer. These were administrative responses,
approvals, or rulings in legal and land-use matters. Often translated as *Instruction from the Fiscal Office* or
*Chamber Order*.

Cammerwahrmeister:: Variant of *Kammerwahrmeister*, referring to a chancellery official or steward/clerk. Related to *Kammerwärter*.

gedacht:: While it normally means *"thought,"* *"intended,"* or *"meant,"* in older German official usage it meant *"aforementioned"* or *"the said."*

Funck:: A historically attested surname. While the image might suggest *Funiz*, that form is not a known or valid name.

desgl.:: Abbreviation for *desgleichen*, meaning *"likewise"* or *"similarly."*
