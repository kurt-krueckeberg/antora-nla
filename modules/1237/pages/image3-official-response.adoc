= Official Response to Petition and Land Assignment Report

The *marginal note* in the image is a response to the remitted xref:image3-land-assignment-report[Land
Assignment Report], but not a formal reply addressed to Krückeberg. It is an internal instruction,
filed with the main document for reference and action. It is a reaction from the higher office (the
Kammer), giving administrative directives:

* Approving the allocation of the parcel (so Krückeberg’s request is likely approved).  Instructing the local
* officials to investigate other possibly unauthorized garden expansions in Berenbusch and to report back.

It was written in the left margin the Land Assignment Report and encroaches on its text. To aid readability, the
text of the Land Assigment Report has been erased from the imaage.

=== Glossary of Terms and Archaic Spellings

*Vormundschaftliche Kammer*:: Literally "Guardianship Chamber", but in the context of early modern German
principalities like Schaumburg-Lippe, this refers to a fiscal-administrative authority operating under a regency or
in the absence of a ruling count. It handled official matters such as land sales, rents, taxation, and resource
management. It did not primarily concern itself with the guardianship of individuals, but rather served as the
ruling administrative body.

*remittiren*:: An older spelling of *remittieren*, meaning to submit, transmit, or refer officially. In this
administrative context, it means to formally send a report or petition from a lower authority (like a local Amt) to
a higher authority (like the Vormundschaftliche Kammer) for decision or approval.

*Betr.*:: Abbreviation for *Betreff*, meaning "subject" or "regarding." Commonly used in official documents to
indicate the topic or reference line.

*Ausweisung*:: Allotment or designation of land, often used in administrative or land management contexts.

*beurtheilen*:: Archaic spelling of *beurteilen*, meaning "to judge" or "to assess".

*Cammer*:: Archaic form of *Kammer*, meaning "chamber" or "department", often used in historical administrative
contexts such as *Rentkammer* (revenue chamber).

*Erbtheil*:: Archaic compound of *Erbteil*, meaning "inheritance share". *Theil* is the older spelling of *Teil*
("part").

*Früchte*:: Literally "fruits", in this context referring to harvested crops or produce.

*Köter*:: Not a given name but a social designation in rural contexts; refers to a cottager or smallholder (German:
*Kötter*). It was sometimes used before the person's name.

*Platz*:: A plot or parcel of land.

*Rottzins*:: A type of feudal land rent (often a quit-rent) payable by tenants for cleared land (*Rodung* =
clearing).

*sehn*:: Likely an archaic or regional variant spelling of *sein* ("to be"). In this context, the verb *dahin sein*
is part of a periphrastic construction implying intent or obligation (e.g., "to make sure" or "to ensure"). It is
almost certainly a Kurrentschrift “h” in the image, and the meaning is parallel to *sein*, not *sehen* ("to see").

*Theil*:: Archaic form of *Teil*, meaning "part" or "portion". Common in 18th–19th century German.

*Vormundschaftlich(e)*:: Pertaining to guardianship, used in administrative contexts (e.g., *vormundschaftliche
Kammer* = "guardianship chamber", i.e., a noble fiscal or estate authority acting on behalf of a minor or estate).

*Weg zur Einfahrt*:: The route or access path for bringing in goods (e.g., agricultural produce).

*Bepflanzung*:: Planting or cultivation of vegetation, usually in a specific area. In this context, refers to the
unauthorized planting of willow trees on the disputed land.

*Weiden Bäume*:: Willow trees. Willow planting may have been used to indicate land use or claim over a piece of
ground.

*eigenmächtiger Weise*:: Unlawfully or without official permission. Literally, “in an arbitrary or unauthorized
manner.”

*deferire*:: (Latin) “to defer to” or “to grant.” Used in formal decisions, often meaning “to comply with” or “to
yield to a request.” Here, the phrase *nicht zu deferire stehe mögte* implies that the authorities found no
obligation to defer to the objection.

*nicht vor der Art ist*:: A somewhat archaic legal phrase meaning “is not of the kind” or “not of the nature” that
would justify a specific action (here, denying the land assignment).

*vorzüglich*:: Especially, particularly. Used to emphasize a specific cause or detail (e.g., “vorzüglich veranlaßt”
= “especially caused by”).
