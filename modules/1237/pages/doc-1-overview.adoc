= Document 1: Petition and Forestry Office Assessment Regarding Land Expansion (29–30 May 1798) 

== Document 1: Narrative Overview

=== 1. The Petition is Initiated at the Amt (≤ 29 May 1798)

In late May 1798, _Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg_, a tenant farmer holding farmstead No. 10 in the village of _Berenbusch_, approached the _Amt in Bückeburg_. His goal was to request additional land to expand his farmyard and garden.

Krückeberg likely spoke to an official named _Lindemann_, who recorded the petition for him — a common practice for semi-literate or illiterate petitioners. Lindemann formalized the request and noted in the final endorsement:

[verse]
____
Bückeburg, den 29t. Mai 1798.  
unterschriebner Lindemann geh. pro St.  
Col. Krückeberg No. 10 zu Berenbusch  
____

This identifies Lindemann as the scribe of the petition, acting on Krückeberg’s behalf.

=== 2. The Petition is Forwarded to the Cammer (30 May 1798)

On the next day — 30 May 1798 — the _Vormundschaftliche Cammer_ (a high-level chamber of financial and administrative oversight in Schaumburg-Lippe) received and logged the petition. This is noted in the upper right header as:

[verse]
____
Nr: 1  
praes: 30. May 1798  
____

The number “1” suggests that this was the first case file in a sequence related to land requests or forestry matters at that time.

=== 3. Forestry Assessment by MKaas (14 June 1798)

Upon reviewing the petition, the Cammer initiated a review process by consulting the _Forstamt_, the forestry authority, likely to ensure that the land Krückeberg requested would not unduly affect timber resources or regulated forest land.

An official named _MKaas_ was tasked with preparing this report. On 14 June 1798, he authored an assessment, which appears directly below the left-side header of Document 1:

[quote]
____
Der verlangte Platz liegt in der Nähe des Dorfes Berenbusch ...  
____

MKaas concluded that:

- The area in question was near the village and not part of any important forest tract,
- The land could be cleared, but three saplings should be planted elsewhere as compensation.

This shows the Forstamt found no major objections to the request.

His signature, “MKaas,” appears at the end, likely followed by “Forstamt,” confirming his institutional affiliation.

=== 4. Return of the Document to the Amt (18 February 1799)

Several months later, on 18 February 1799, MKaas added a short administrative note written vertically in the lower left corner:

[verse]
____
Res Cam. Brevi manu dem  
Amte zum Berichte. B. 18.  
Febr 1799  
MKaas  
____

This Latin-German phrase roughly means:

> “By order of the Cammer, hand-delivered to the Amt for a report.”

This suggests that the Cammer returned the entire case file, including the petition and forestry report, to the Amt — possibly to inform Krückeberg or to request a response or implementation.
