In the 1830s, Johann Heinrich Krückeberg's inherited his parent's debt from his father's shoemaking trade.
On *May 29, 1840* and again on *June 6, 1840*, the Amt Bückeburg, the local governmental office in Bückeburg,
acting in its dual capacity as a court, ordered payment of *133 Reichsthaler 7 Mariengroschen, plus 5% interest
from 9 April 1833*{fn-amt-decree}. 

[NOTE]
====
A Reichsthaler (rt) was equivalent to 24 Mariengroschen (mg) 
====

When he still could not pay, the Amt on *July 13, 1841* ordered the bailiff Möller to collect, and warned if no
payment came within fourteen days{fn-execution}, that distraint (the seizure of his assets) and sale would follow.
Under that pressure Krückeberg turned to the Rentkammer, petitioning on *2 October 1841* (and again on *11/12 November
1841*) for relief.{fn-petitions}.

The **Rentcammer** in Schaumburg-Lippe in 1841 was:  
* the **treasury** of the principality (managing the prince’s revenues and expenditures),  the **chief accounting
* office** (keeping the ledgers, reviewing and auditing the Amts’ accounts), and  the **property management
* authority** (overseeing farmland, forests, mills, and other sources of income within the state).  

As the higher financial authority of the state, the Rentcammer had the power to review the Amt’s decree and decide
whether to grant Johann Heinrich relief—such as a loan—or to let the order stand.  

When a father died with debts, they did not vanish. As heir and head of household, Johann Heinrich inherited the
obligation — and now, as a Colon with land use, he finally had something the Amt could enforce against. 

Meanwhile the *Amt’s report of 7 October 1841* to the Chamber confirmed the
judgment (133 rt 7 mg, 5% since 1833), noted the long litigation (pending since *30 July 1836*, twice _in
appellatorio_, once _supplicatorio_), stated there was no legal basis to impose installments and that the creditor
would not accept them, and recorded that execution was *temporarily stayed* while the Chamber considered the
case.{fn-amt-report} If relief was to be granted at all, the Amt proposed a *190 rt* Chamber loan *secured on his
leasehold farmstead (Stelle/Stätte No. 10)*, noting *10 Morgen 30 Ruthen* of land, buildings insured at *525 rt*,
and existing encumbrances of *700 rt*.{fn-security} A *15 November 1841* valuation memo reckoned land and buildings
at *1,525 rt*, left *825 rt* after debts, and the reviewing official declined to recommend the loan; the Chamber
board noted *to be rejected*.{fn-valuation} Through all of this, the risk of a *forced sale of the farmstead*
remained real—indeed, Krückeberg himself reports that the *Amt threatened to sell his holding* if he failed to
raise the money.{fn-threat}


.What “holding” means here
****
[TIP]
====
*"holding"* is the translation chosen for *Stelle/Stätte (No. 10, Berenbusch)*, the *leasehold farm unit*:
the plot and farm buildings, with the right to use the land. The land itself belonged to the princely domain; the
Colon held a long-term, usually inheritable lease with duties attached.

In this system where a Colon (tenant farmer) held a long-term, inheritable lease to a numbered farm (Stelle/Stätte),
the soil belonged to the princely domain, but the buildings and improvements were the tenant’s property (or at
least under his proprietary control). 

*In practice*:

* the *"holding"* could be pledged as *security (collateral)* for a loan.  
* On default, authorities could *auction the lease right and buildings* to satisfy the judgment.

=== Overview

On *2 October 1841* in Bückeburg, *Johann Heinrich Krückeberg* (Colon No. 10, Berenbusch) submits a *petition
to the Princely Rentkammer*. He explains that his late parents’ shoemaking business left a *large leather debt*
to *Hempel & Söhne (Minden)*; judgment has now been entered against him and he faces *distraint*. Unable to pay
in full, he asks the Chamber to *consent to a new loan of 150 Reichsthaler* and to allow him to *pay the
remaining (unconsolidated) balance in annual installments of 5 thalers*. He notes his holding already carries
*700 thalers in consented debts*, but says he has no other way out despite the added interest burden. The
petition closes with the standard deferential formula. Marginal dockets route the matter *to the Amt for a
report* (noted *4 Oct 1841*) and show it was *drafted by G. W. Fuchs (Conc.)* and registered under *N. C. 438
i*.

=== Timline: Hempel Söhne v. Krückeberg (1841)

29 May 1841 & 6 June 1841::  
Decrees issued by the Amt ordering Johann Heinrich Krückeberg (Colon No. 10, Berenbusch) to pay  
*133 Reichsthaler 7 Mariengroschen plus 5% annual interest from 9 April 1833.*  
Krückeberg does not comply.

10 July 1841::  
Advocate Meyer, attorney for the plaintiffs (Hempel Söhne of Minden), files a petition before the Amt.  
He requests that the threatened *enforcement of judgment (Execution)* be decreed,  
with the warning of *seizure of property (Auspfandung).*  
Clerk’s note: *entered, issued, as a default judgment (ref: exp: contum: infidem).*  
Signed: F. Sander.  
Krückeberg is not present and does not know of this filing.

13 July 1841::  
The Amt issues its *decree (Decretum):*  
* The petition is to be communicated to Krückeberg in copy.  
* *Enforcement of judgment (Execution)* is ordered.  
* Court officer (Amtsdiener) Möller is instructed to enforce collection of the debt (principal + interest + 4 Mariengroschen fee).  
* Möller is to warn Krückeberg that, if enforcement proves fruitless and no payment is made within 14 days,  
then upon further request of the plaintiffs, *seizure of property (Auspfandung)* will immediately be decreed and carried out.  
Signed by Amt officials Hauck and Höcker.

Mein verstorbener Vater und nach dessen Tode auch meine Mutter,
die das Handwerk meines Vaters, eines Schuhmachers, fortsetzte,
haben bei den Kaufleuten und Gerber Hempel Söhne in Minden eine
bedeutende Lederschuld gewirkt, die jetzt mit Zinsen gegen mich
ausgeklagt ist, und derentwegen, wie anliegender Bescheid des
Amts bekundet, ich mit Auspfandung bedroht bin. Mir ist es
unmöglich, diese ganze Summe aus eigenen vorräthiger Mitteln zu
bezahlen, und ich weiß mich nicht anders zu helfen, als durch ein
neues Darlehn von 150 Rthl und die Erlangung der Vergünstigung,
den Rest in jährlichen Terminen von 5 Rthlr abtragen zu können.
Auf meiner

Nr pr: 1274 [at bottom of first page]

meiner Stätte haften zwar schon 700 Rthl consentirter Schulden,
allein ich kann mir nicht anders helfen, so ungern ich auch noch
meine Zinsen last vergrößern.  Ew. Durchlaucht muß ich daher
unterthänigst bitten:

mir gnädigst den Consens zu einem neuen Anlehn von 150 Rthl zu
ertheilen und dann zu verfügen daß ich der Rest der
unconfendirten Hempelischen Forderung in jährlichen terminen von
5 Rthlr abträgen könne.

In tiefster Ehrfurcht ersterbend

Cammeral file no. 483i

presented in incoming [matters] 2 Oct 1841

[NOTE: Registry entry no. 1274 (archival notation)]


Most Serene Prince, gracious reigning Prince and Lord,

[Referred to] the office report
B[ückeburg], 4 Oct 1841

[instruction/minute by the responsible official]
(On this leaf:) keep with me for the Amtsbericht.
Bückeburg, 4 Oct 1841.
[Samg/Spreng]

My late father—and, after his death, my mother, who continued my
father’s trade as a shoemaker— incurred a substantial leather
debt with the merchants and tanners Hempel & Sons in Minden.
This debt, with interest, has now been adjudged against me,
and—as the attached notice from the district office shows—I am
threatened with distraint (seizure). It is impossible for me to
pay the entire amount from my own available means, and I see no
other remedy than to obtain a new loan of 150 thalers and to be
granted the favor of paying off the remainder in annual
installments of 5 thalers.

Registry entry no. 1274 

There are already 700 thalers in officially authorized debts
secured on my holding ([i.e.,] mortgages registered on the
property); nevertheless, the only way I can deal with the Hempel
claim is to take on further borrowing—much as I dislike
increasing my burden of interest payments. I therefore most
humbly request:

that Your Serene Highness graciously consent to a new loan of 150
thalers and then decree that I may repay the remainder of the
not-yet-authorized Hempel claim in yearly installments of 5
thalers.

In deepest respect,

Your Serene Highness’s
most humble servant,
tenant farmer Krückeberg
No. 10 in Berenbusch.

Bückeburg, the 2nd (of the same month), 1841.
