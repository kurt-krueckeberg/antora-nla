In the 1830s a leather debt from Johann Heinrich Krückeberg’s parents’ shoemaking trade rolled forward onto him.
The creditor, Hempel & Söhne of Minden, sued; by *29 May / 6 June 1840* the Amt Bückeburg (acting as a court) had
ordered payment, with *5% interest back to 9 Apr 1833*. When he still couldn’t pay, the court moved to enforcement:
on *10/13 Jul 1841* it ordered execution and warned that *distraint* and a *sale of his holding (Stelle/Stätte No.
10, Berenbusch)* would follow if payment failed. Under that pressure, Krückeberg turned to the *Rentkammer* for
relief: first on *2 Oct 1841*, then again *11/12 Nov 1841*, asking to borrow from the Chamber treasury and/or pay
in installments. The Amt’s report of *7 Oct 1841* confirmed the judgment and said there was *no legal basis* to
force installments; it proposed instead a Chamber loan of *190 Reichsthaler (rt)*, using the holding as security. A
valuation on *15 Nov 1841* set the holding at *1,525 rt*, less *700 rt* debts (= *825 rt* remaining), and the
reviewer *could not recommend* the loan; the Chamber board noted *“to be rejected.”* Through it all, execution was
*temporarily stayed* while the Chamber considered the request, but the threat of a forced sale remained very real.
That’s the moment we’re seeing: a tenant farmer, squeezed between a court judgment and a cautious treasury, trying
every formal avenue to keep his farm.


.What “holding” means here

[TIP]
====
*"holding"* is the translation chosen for *Stelle/Stätte (No. 10, Berenbusch)*, which was a *leasehold farm unit*:
the plot and farm buildings, with the right to use the land. The land itself belonged to the princely domain; the
Colon (from colonus) held a long-term, usually inheritable lease with duties attached.

In this system a Colon (tenant farmer) held a long-term, inheritable lease to a numbered farm (Stelle/Stätte). The
soil belonged to the princely domain, but the buildings and improvements were the tenant’s property (or at least
under his proprietary control). 

*In practice:*  
* the *"holding"* could be pledged as *security (collateral)* for a loan.  
* On default, authorities could *auction the lease right and buildings* to satisfy the judgment.
