In the 1830s, Johann Heinrich Krückeberg's inherited his parent's debt from his father's shoemaking trade.
On *May 29, 1840* and again on *June 6, 1840*, the Amt Bückeburg, the local governmental office in Bückeburg,
acting in its dual capacity as a court, ordered payment of *133 Reichsthaler 7 Mariengroschen, plus 5% interest
from 9 April 1833*{fn-amt-decree}. 

[NOTE]
====
A Reichsthaler (rt) was equivalent to 24 Mariengroschen (mg) 
====

When he still could not pay, the Amt on *July 13, 1841* ordered the bailiff Möller to collect, and warned if no
payment came within fourteen days{fn-execution}, that distraint (the seizure of his assets) and sale would follow.
Under that pressure Krückeberg turned to the Rentkammer, petitioning on *2 October 1841* (and again on *11/12 November
1841*) for relief.{fn-petitions}.

The **Rentcammer** in Schaumburg-Lippe in 1841 was:  
* the **treasury** of the principality (managing the prince’s revenues and expenditures),  the **chief accounting
* office** (keeping the ledgers, reviewing and auditing the Amts’ accounts), and  the **property management
* authority** (overseeing farmland, forests, mills, and other sources of income within the state).  

As the higher financial authority of the state, the Rentcammer had the power to review the Amt’s decree and decide
whether to grant Johann Heinrich relief—such as a loan—or to let the order stand.  

When a father died with debts, they did not vanish. As heir and head of household, Johann Heinrich inherited the
obligation — and now, as a Colon with land use, he finally had something the Amt could enforce against. 

Meanwhile the *Amt’s report of 7 October 1841* to the Chamber confirmed the
judgment (133 rt 7 mg, 5% since 1833), noted the long litigation (pending since *30 July 1836*, twice _in
appellatorio_, once _supplicatorio_), stated there was no legal basis to impose installments and that the creditor
would not accept them, and recorded that execution was *temporarily stayed* while the Chamber considered the
case.{fn-amt-report} If relief was to be granted at all, the Amt proposed a *190 rt* Chamber loan *secured on his
leasehold farmstead (Stelle/Stätte No. 10)*, noting *10 Morgen 30 Ruthen* of land, buildings insured at *525 rt*,
and existing encumbrances of *700 rt*.{fn-security} A *15 November 1841* valuation memo reckoned land and buildings
at *1,525 rt*, left *825 rt* after debts, and the reviewing official declined to recommend the loan; the Chamber
board noted *to be rejected*.{fn-valuation} Through all of this, the risk of a *forced sale of the farmstead*
remained real—indeed, Krückeberg himself reports that the *Amt threatened to sell his holding* if he failed to
raise the money.{fn-threat}


.What “holding” means here
****
[TIP]
====
*"holding"* is the translation chosen for *Stelle/Stätte (No. 10, Berenbusch)*, the *leasehold farm unit*:
the plot and farm buildings, with the right to use the land. The land itself belonged to the princely domain; the
Colon held a long-term, usually inheritable lease with duties attached.

In this system where a Colon (tenant farmer) held a long-term, inheritable lease to a numbered farm (Stelle/Stätte),
the soil belonged to the princely domain, but the buildings and improvements were the tenant’s property (or at
least under his proprietary control). 

*In practice*:

* the *"holding"* could be pledged as *security (collateral)* for a loan.  
* On default, authorities could *auction the lease right and buildings* to satisfy the judgment.
