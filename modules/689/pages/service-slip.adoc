== Transliteration and Translation

These look like Amt-level service/processing fees, not fees charged by the Rentkammer itself. The slip is signed by
Möller, Amtsdiener, and refers to the insinuation (formal service) of the “gleichlautendes Gegenbescheid”
(“identically worded counterpart of the notice”) on 27 July 1841. The row labels (likely Decr., Exp., Not.) are
standard fee-book abbreviations for decree/dispatch/notification at the Amt. They’re the costs of preparing and
serving that notice, typically chargeable to the party.
