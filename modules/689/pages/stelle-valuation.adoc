== Overview

On 15 November 1841, a Rentcammer clerk prepared a formal valuation of Krückeberg’s farmstead and buildings. After
deducting debts, he calculated a net worth of 825 Reichsthaler, but judged it doubtful whether a further 200 rt
loan would be secure. Although acknowledging loans had been made in worse cases, he recommended against approval,
and the Gesuch was marked to be refused.

A same-day note from the Chamber board adds, tersely, that the petition should be rejected. In short: the numbers
didn’t convince the authorities that a rescue loan was secure, and the risk of a forced sale stayed very real.

== Transliteration and Translation

."holding" and "vot." Explained
****
[NOTE]
====
* *"holding"* is translated from "Stelle" (and elsewhere "Stätte"). It refers to the *"leasehold farm
holding of a numbered Colon (tenant farmer), comprising land and buildings."*
* *vot.* is short of votum and means the  Clerk’s/official’s written **opinion, his recommendation,** submitted to the
Chamber. It is not a vote tally.

Die Stelle des Krückeberg besteht

aus 10 Morgen a 100 rt_______1000 rt

Sollte die Stelle zum Verkauf kommen,
so möchte es immer noch zur Frage
kommen, ob nach Abrechnung der
Lasten für das erbetene Dar-
lehn von 200 rt Deckung erfolgen
würde. Obgleich nicht zu leugnen,
daß schon Darlehen unter noch
misslicheren Verhältnissen be-
willigt worden sind, so mag
ich ein solches doch nicht be[für-
worten] und kaum daher die
Bewilligung oder Verweigerung
lediglich dem Ermessen der Cam-
mer anheimgeben.

The holding of Krückeberg consists of

10 Morgen at 100 rt each ___________ 1000 rt
Cadastral value of the buildings ____ 525 rt
                                ____________
                                      1525 rt
less debts ___________________________ 700 -
                    remaining value    825 rt


Should the holding come up for sale, the question would still arise
whether, after deducting the encumbrances, the requested loan of
200 thalers would be covered. Although it cannot be denied that
loans have already been granted under still more unfavorable
conditions, I cannot recommend such a loan here and therefore
leave approval or refusal entirely to the discretion of the Chamber.
Bbg., 15 Nov. 1841.

[Ricke/Reitz]

KC. The petition should be rejected.
