= Overview

In the 1830s a leather debt from Johann Heinrich Krückeberg’s parents’ shoemaking trade rolled forward onto him.
The creditor, Hempel & Söhne of Minden, sued; 

On May 19 and June 6, 1841, the Amt?? decreed that Johann Heinrich Krückeberg pay them 133 Reichsthaler [Rthlr
struck through] 7 Mariengroschen together with 5 percent interest from 9 April 1833.

When he couldn't pay, their attorney, on July 10, 1841, requested before the Amt threaten Krückeberg with
distraint (the forced sale of his tenant farm holding) should he not pay. The Amt agreed and on July 13, 1841,
Court officer Möller was sent to to inform Krückeberg "that if the execution proves unsuccessful and if no
payment is made within 14 days, then upon further request by the plaintiffs, distraint will be ordered and carried
out immediately."

Distraint meant the forced sale of his holding (Stelle/Stätte No. 10, Berenbusch)

Under that pressure, Krückeberg turned to the Rentkammer for relief:
first on 2 Oct 1841, then again 11/12 Nov 1841, asking to borrow from the Chamber treasury and/or pay in
installments. The Amt’s report of 7 Oct 1841 confirmed the judgment and said there was no legal basis to force
installments; it proposed instead a Chamber loan of 190 Reichsthaler (rt), using the holding as security. A
valuation on 15 Nov 1841 set the holding at 1,525 rt, less 700 rt debts (= 825 rt remaining), and the reviewer
could not recommend the loan; the Chamber board noted “to be rejected.” Through it all, execution was temporarily
stayed while the Chamber considered the request, but the threat of a forced sale remained very real. That’s the
moment we’re seeing: a tenant farmer, squeezed between a court judgment and a cautious treasury, trying every
formal avenue to keep his farm.
