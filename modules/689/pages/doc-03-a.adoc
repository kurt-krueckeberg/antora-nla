= Sale Risk and Loan Coverage: Clerk’s Opinion on Krückeberg’s Holding — 15 Nov 1841

image::09-r.png[scale=75,link=self]

== Overview

On November 15, 1841, a clerk in Bückeburg set out, in a few lines, what Johann Heinrich Krückeberg’s farm was
worth and whether a new loan made sense. He valued the land at 1,000 Reichsthaler (10 morgens at 100 rt each) and
the buildings at 525 rt, for a total of 1,525 rt; after subtracting 700 rt in debts, only 825 rt remained. The memo
then asks whether a proposed 200-rt loan would be safely covered if the holding had to be sold—and answers, in
effect, no. The reviewer writes that he cannot recommend granting the loan and leaves the decision to the Chamber
(the princely finance office). A same-day note from the Chamber board adds, tersely, that the petition should be
rejected. In short: the numbers didn’t convince the authorities that a rescue loan was secure, and the risk of a
forced sale stayed very real.

Die Stelle des Krückeberg besteht

aus 10 Morgen a 100 rt_______1000 rt
Catasterwerth der Gebäude____525rt
               -------------------
                            1525 rt
davon ab Schulden.___________700 -
               bleibt Werth  825 rt


Sollte die Stelle zum Verkauf kommen,
so möchte es immer noch zur Frage
kommen, ob nach Abrechnung der
Lasten für das erbetene Dar-
lehn von 200 rt Deckung erfolgen
würde. Obgleich nicht zu leugnen,
daß schon Darlehen unter noch
misslicheren Verhältnissen be-
willigt worden sind, so mag
ich ein solches doch nicht be[für-
worten] und kaum daher die
Bewilligung oder Verweigerung
lediglich dem Ermessen der Cam-
mer anheimgeben.

Should the holding come up for sale, the question would still arise
whether, after deducting the encumbrances, the requested loan of
200 thalers would be covered. Although it cannot be denied that
loans have already been granted under still more unfavorable
conditions, I cannot recommend such a loan here and therefore
leave approval or refusal entirely to the discretion of the Chamber.
Bbg., 15 Nov. 1841.
