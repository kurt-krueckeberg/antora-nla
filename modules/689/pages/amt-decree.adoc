== Overview and Summary

On *10 July 1841* at the *Amt Bückeburg*, the creditor *Hempel & Söhne of Minden* pressed their case against
*Johann Heinrich Krückeberg* (Colon No. 10, Berenbusch). Their attorney, *Advokat Meyer*, told the Amt that
Krückeberg still had not paid as he’d been ordered to do by decrees of *29 May* and *6 June* (of the *previous
year*), and he asked that the *threatened “execution”* be put into effect—meaning formal enforcement of the
judgment, up to and including *distraint* (seizure).

On *13 July 1841* the Amt issued its *Decretum*: the order was to be served on Krückeberg; *execution was now
recognized*, and the *Amtsdiener Möller* (the court bailiff) was instructed to levy for the *principal of 133
Reichsthaler 7 Mariengroschen*, plus *5% interest from 9 April 1833* and a *4-Mariengroschen fee*. Krückeberg
was to be warned that *if the levy proved fruitless and no payment came within 14 days*, the creditor could, upon
further request, have *distraint immediately ordered and carried out*.

In short, this document records the *turn from warning to active enforcement*: the court tells its bailiff to
proceed, sets the exact *sum and interest*, and puts Krückeberg on a *14-day clock* toward seizure if he does
not pay.

=== Terms

*distraint* in the text means the legal seizure of property to compel payment.

A *default judgment* means a court decision that is entered against a party who fails to take part in the case
— usually because they don’t show up, don’t respond, or otherwise ignore the summons.

In older German legal language (in contumaciam), it meant:

* The defendant did not appear when summoned, or

* The defendant refused to answer or participate,

* So the court decided the matter without hearing their side and in favor of the other party.

So in your Krückeberg document, when the clerk writes _contum._, he’s noting that the judgment was rendered
because of *Krückeberg’s non-appearance (or non-response)*, not after a contested hearing.

Done at Bückeburg, at the Amt
on the 10th of July 1841


        In the matter of

the Hempel Sons in Minden, plaintiffs,
          versus
the Colon [farmer] Krückeberg No. 10 in
Berenbusch, defendant,
         [Total] capital and
         interest.

Advocate Meyer, attorney for the plaintiffs, most respectfully
requested that, since the defendant Krückeberg has still not—
as was ordered to him by decree of the 29th of May and 6th of
June of last year—paid the sum of 133 Reichsthaler 7 Groschen
together with 5 percent annual interest from the 9th of April
1833, the threatened **enforcement of judgment**, with warning
of distraint [seizure of property], now be decreed.

Entered and issued as a default judgment, in witness thereof.
       F. Sander

      Decree

The foregoing petition is to be communicated to the defendant in
copy, and the enforcement of judgment is now ordered. The court
officer Möller is ordered to collect from the defendant the
principal of 133 Reichsthaler 7 Mariengroschen, interest at 5
percent from 9 April 1833, and a fee of 4 Mariengroschen.  He is
further to make clear to him that, if this enforcement proves
fruitless and no payment is made within 14 days, then upon
further request of the plaintiffs seizure of property (distraint)
will immediately be ordered and carried out.

Decreed at Bückeburg, the 13th of July 1841.
Princely Schaumburg District Office.
