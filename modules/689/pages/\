In the 1830s a leather debt from his parents’ shoemaking trade rolled forward onto Johann Heinrich Krückeberg; by
**29 May** and **6 June 1840** the Amt Bückeburg, acting as a court, had ordered payment with **5% interest from 9
April 1833**.footnote:[fn-amt-decree]. When he still could not pay, the Amt on **10/13 July 1841** ordered execution, instructed the
bailiff Möller to levy, and warned that distraint and sale would follow if no payment came within fourteen
days.footnote:[fn-execution, The **10 Jul 1841** motion and **13 Jul 1841 Decretum** direct the Amtsdiener
**Möller** to execute for **133 rt 7 mg** plus **5% since 9 Apr 1833**, with a 14-day warning of **Auspfändung**
(distraint) and sale. xref:amt-decree.adoc[Amt Bückeburg — Decree & Execution Order (10/13 Jul 1841)].] Under that
pressure Krückeberg turned to the Rentkammer, petitioning on **2 October 1841** (and again on **11/12 November
1841**) for relief.footnote:[fn-petitions, First petition: **2 Oct 1841** (requests consent to a new loan and
installment terms), xref:doc-01.adoc[Document 1 — Petition (2 Oct 1841)]; second petition: drafted **11 Nov**,
presented **12 Nov 1841** (asks for a **200 rt** Chamber loan), xref:doc-03.adoc[Document 3 — Petition (11/12 Nov
1841)].] Meanwhile the **Amt’s report of 7 October 1841** to the Chamber confirmed the judgment (133 rt 7 mg, 5%
since 1833), noted the long litigation (pending since **30 July 1836**, twice *in appellatorio*, once
*supplicatorio*), stated there was no legal basis to impose installments and that the creditor would not accept
them, and recorded that execution was **temporarily stayed** while the Chamber considered the
case.footnote:[fn-amt-report, **Amt Bückeburg to Rentkammer, 7 Oct 1841**: confirms amount/interest, recounts the
appellate history since **30 Jul 1836**, rejects court-ordered installments, notes creditor’s refusal, and says
execution is *einstweilen sistirt* (temporarily stayed). xref:doc-02.adoc[Document 2 — Amt report (7 Oct 1841)].]
If relief was to be granted at all, the Amt proposed a **190 rt** Chamber loan **secured on his leasehold farmstead
(Stelle/Stätte No. 10)**, noting **10 Morgen 30 Ruthen** of land, buildings insured at **525 rt**, and existing
encumbrances of **700 rt**.footnote:[fn-security, Loan proposal and collateral details appear in **Doc 2 (7 Oct
1841)**: **190 rt** loan; holding size **10 Morgen 30 Ruthen**; **Hofsgebäude** insured at **525 rt**; **700 rt**
in encumbrances already on the holding. xref:doc-02.adoc[Document 2 — Amt report (7 Oct 1841)].] A **15 November
1841** valuation memo reckoned land and buildings at **1,525 rt**, left **825 rt** after debts, and the reviewing
official declined to recommend the loan; the Chamber board noted **to be rejected**.footnote:[fn-valuation,
**Valuation & votum, 15 Nov 1841**: table totals **1,525 rt** (land **1,000** + buildings **525**), less **700** =
**825 rt** remaining; the reviewer writes he cannot **befürworten** the loan; the K.C. docket marks
**abzuschlagen**. xref:valuation-1841-11-15.adoc[Valuation & Opinion (15 Nov 1841)].] Through all of this, the risk
of a **forced sale of the farmstead** remained real—indeed, Krückeberg himself reports that the **Amt threatened to
sell his holding** if he failed to raise the money.footnote:[fn-threat, Krückeberg’s second petition (presented
**12 Nov 1841**) says plainly: “das Amt drohet mit dem Verkaufe meiner Stätte.” xref:doc-03.adoc[Document 3 —
Petition (11/12 Nov 1841)].]

.What “holding” means here
****
[TIP]
====
*"holding"* is the translation chosen for *Stelle/Stätte (No. 10, Berenbusch)*, the *leasehold farm unit*:
the plot and farm buildings, with the right to use the land. The land itself belonged to the princely domain; the
Colon held a long-term, usually inheritable lease with duties attached.

In this system where a Colon (tenant farmer) held a long-term, inheritable lease to a numbered farm (Stelle/Stätte),
the soil belonged to the princely domain, but the buildings and improvements were the tenant’s property (or at
least under his proprietary control). 

*In practice*:

* the *"holding"* could be pledged as *security (collateral)* for a loan.  
* On default, authorities could *auction the lease right and buildings* to satisfy the judgment.

recalls the decrees of **29 May** and **6 June 1840** and the interest base (**5% since 9 Apr 1833**). The Amt then
issues its own execution order on **13 Jul 1841**. xref:amt-decree.adoc[Amt Bückeburg — Decree & Execution Order
