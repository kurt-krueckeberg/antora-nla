= 200 Reichstaler lent to Krückeberg No. 10 in Berenbusch.

In 1849 when Johann Heinrich emigrated from Schaumburg-Lippe and settled in Union Township, Adams County, Indiana,
he arrived from a principality only three and a half times the size of Union Township and one with only 20,000
inhabitants. Years earlier, in 1798, when his father Jobst wanted to purchase land from the government to enlarge
his farm yard and garden, the Vormundschaftliche Cammer (Guardianship or Regency Chamber) granted his request.

The "Guardianship Chamber" or "Regency Chamber" was the primary governing council responsible for the
administration of the state and the management of its finances and domains during the minority of the heir, Count
George William. The regency was led by Countess Juliane of Schaumburg-Lippe, who was the mother of the minor
heir, Count George William. She had been appointed regent in 1787 after the death of her husband, Count Philip II.
Her regency, conducted with the assistance of Count Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn, was notable for its
beneficial reforms in economics and education. 

By 1841 the regency no longer existed. This was when Johann Heinrich's sore financial trials were entered into the
public record. And this time it would be the Rentcammer who would would past judgement on him and his
creditor.

those documents nor the events in the life of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg that those dates represent. The story flow
