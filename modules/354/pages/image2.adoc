Erschien H. Reinecke, stellete vor,  
wasgestalt Jobst Krückenbergs an Hoffe  
des H. Drosten von dem Brinck be-  
legenes Haus in einem gar bau-  
fälligen und fast ruinösen Stande  
wäre, weil nun dieser Krückenberg  
von vielen Jahren unvor die Contr-  
bution restirete, und zu befürchten, daß,  
wenn selbiges Haus einfällt, die Stadt  
darunter Schaden leiden würde; bat  
also, weil Krückenberg nicht im Stande,  
das Geringste davon aufzubringen, überdies  
er schon so viel an Contribution schul-  
dig als das Haus wert, und man  
die Stadt jetzo bekanntermaßen einer  
gar großen Bedürftigkeit, also wolte er  
mit Substitution dieses Hauses, in einer  
Subhasta, weil es zum gänzlichen Besten  
stände, hinlänglich gegebenen Gehorsam habe.

Comiti dem Kirchenbuch zur Nachricht,  
et praefigat Tag ad Subhastam  
auf den 15. künftigen  
Monats Xbr. Dec. eod.

Mr. Reinecke appeared and presented
how Jobst Krückenberg’s house,
situated on the estate of Mr. Drost von dem Brinck,
was in a very dilapidated and nearly ruined condition.
Since Krückenberg has been in arrears
on the contributions for many years,
there is concern that if the house collapses,
the city could suffer damage as a result.
He therefore requested—since Krückenberg
is not in a position to contribute the least amount,
and in addition already owes as much in contributions
as the house is worth, and since
the city is presently, as is well known,
in great need—that he be permitted,
with substitution of this house,
to proceed with a forced sale (Subhasta),
as it would be entirely for the best;
he had duly received prior authorization for this.

To be brought to the Count’s attention,
and entered into the church office register for information,
and a date for the forced sale (Subhasta)
be set for the 15th of the coming
month of December of this year.
