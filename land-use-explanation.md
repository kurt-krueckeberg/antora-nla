You’re right to want this in plain, human terms. Here’s a clean, self-contained explainer, then a walk-through of the “Stand” words you tallied and what their mix says about village life.

# How landholding worked (in plain language)

Think of land as having two layers:

1. **The prince’s estate (the “lordship”)** kept a big block of land and rights. That block is often called the **demesne**: fields, meadows, woods, and the income tied to them that legally belonged to the ruler.

2. **Families ran farms on that land** under long-standing rights. A family that ran a full farm was often called a **Meier** (you’ll also see **Meyer**) or, in your area, a **Colon**. In practice here, *Meier* and *Colon* are near-synonyms:

   * A **Meier/Colon** ran a numbered farm (e.g., “No. 10”) for the lordship.
   * He didn’t “own” the farm the way a modern homeowner owns a house, but his **right to run it was inherited in the family**, usually with fixed dues (money, produce, sometimes work days).
   * Think of it as a **family farm under a very strong, long-term right**, supervised by the lordship’s finance office (the **Rentkammer**).

Alongside that core farm, families could also add **extra pieces** in two common ways:

* The domain sometimes **sold a parcel outright**, or
* It **sold a permanent, inheritable right to use** a parcel (functionally very close to ownership).

That’s exactly what your document describes: in **1814** and **1818** the Krückeberg family **paid the domain** for a parcel by the Söhre pasture/forest. Years later, when Krückeberg was in debt to Hempel & Sons, the **Rentkammer considered buying that parcel (or the permanent right to it) back** so he’d have cash to pay his creditors. The head forester inspected it, found **poor drainage and frequent flooding**, valued it at **about half** of what was paid in 1814, and advised **against** the buy-back as **not in the lordship’s interest**. In short: they were *not* buying his whole tenant farm; they were weighing **reacquiring that specific add-on parcel/right** the family had purchased earlier.

# What the church-book “Stand” labels mean

These words describe a person’s **social/economic position at the moment of the entry** (baptism, marriage, burial). They’re quick tags, not full biographies.

* **Hausherr** — literally “house-master”: the **head of a household**. He might be a big farmer, a smallholder, or a craftsman; the word itself doesn’t tell you how much land he has—only that he’s in charge of that dwelling.
* **Einlieger** — a **lodger/subtenant**. Usually has **little or no land**, lives in someone else’s house or on a corner of a farm, works for wages or odd jobs.
* **Knecht** — a **hired farmhand** (male). Works for a farmer; status can change over time.
* **Meier/Meyer** — a **full farm holder** running one of the village’s **numbered farms** for the domain; the **family right is heritable** and comes with dues/obligations.
* **Colon** — in your area, used much like **Meier** for a full farm holder.
* **Anerbe** — the **designated single heir** to a farm within a one-heir system. It’s a **family role**, not a job. It tells you who is slated to take over the core farm.
* **Reuter/Reiter** — a **horseman/soldier**.
* **Carabinier** — also a **soldier** (light cavalry).

## What your counts suggest

You noted (combining your lines): many **Hausherr** and **Einlieger**, very few **Meier**, a fair number of **Anerbe**, and an occasional **Knecht** or **soldier**.

That’s a classic small-state village profile:

* A **small number of full farms** (the Meier/Colon households) sit at the core.
* **Many more dependent or modest households** surround them: **Hausherrn** (heads of small houses) and **Einlieger** (lodgers with little land).
* **Anerbe** entries show which families are managing succession to keep the core farm intact.
* **Knechte** and the odd **soldier** appear as people cycle through service, marriage, or burial.

Two cautions when interpreting:

* A person’s **Stand can change** (a Knecht can later become a Hausherr; an Einlieger can become a smallholder). The label is **“now,”** not “forever.”
* **Scribes vary**. One may prefer “Hausherr,” another may write “Einwohner” or add an occupation; so frequencies are useful, but they reflect **what the scribe chose to note** on those pages.
