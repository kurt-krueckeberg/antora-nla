Question:
The case file index page, the Acten Designation page, list as its first item, dated 2 OCtober 1841, the
"Vorstellung des Col. Krückeberg No 10 in Berenbusch Anb." This is in the left sub-column. under Acten Designation,
and it lists in the left sub-column "Bewilligung eines Darlehens ad 200 r.".  However, document 1i, which was a
request of the attorney Meyer representing the plaintiff Hempel and Söhne, that "the threatened execution be
carried out, under threat of distraint". I have these questions:  `1.) Why does document 1i not appear in the
document index? 2.) What is the threatened execution to be carried it since it is not explicitly mentioned?

Great questions—here’s a clear, two-part answer.

### 1) Why isn’t “Document 1i” in the Acten-Designation (index)?

Because it’s **not one of the Rentkammer’s own core items** for this loan case. That slip/letter from attorney
**Meyer** (for **Hempel & Söhne**) is an **enclosure / outside prompt about enforcement**, likely originating in
the **judicial track** (the creditor’s push to execute the judgment). When such pieces are later **filed into** a
Rentkammer bundle for context, clerks often **don’t give them their own index row**. Instead they sit **behind**
the relevant main item (here, Krückeberg’s petition of **2 Oct 1841** and the **Amt Bückeburg report**), just as
you already saw with other “Copt.” or service slips. In short: the index lists the **principal incoming/outgoing
items** of the Chamber’s loan proceeding; **attachments and third-party nudges** are commonly **unlisted**.

### 2) What is the “threatened execution” that’s to be carried out?

It’s the creditor’s request to **move ahead with enforcement of the judgment**—i.e., **Zwangsvollstreckung**: first
**Auspfändung** (distraint/seizure), then, if needed, the **forced sale/auction** of assets. In this file the asset
plainly in view is Krückeberg’s **Stelle/Stätte** (his leasehold farm holding). The later documents make this
explicit:

* The Amt states that **Auspfändung has been ordered** and even **threatens sale of the holding** if payment isn’t
produced.
* The 15 Nov valuation memo asks whether a **200-thalers loan would be covered** “**should the holding come up for
* sale**.”

So the attorney’s “carry out the threatened execution” means: **proceed from warning to actual levy and, if
necessary, auction** to satisfy **Hempel & Söhne’s** adjudicated claim.
