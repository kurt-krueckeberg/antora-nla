Great question — the key is that *"`Colon`" is a status, not a single
tenure type*. A Colon (from _colonus_) in Schaumburg-Lippe is a full
farm holder (like a Meier): he can hold *different parcels under
different legal regimes at the same time*.

Here’s how your case fits together:

* *Hof Nr. 10 (the colonate):* the _core farm_ is typically held under
*manorial/Meier rights* — the lordship keeps the higher title (_dominium directum_),
and the Colon has the hereditary, obligated use (_dominium utile_). → This part is
*not* what the Rentkammer is valuing in Doc.  5–6.
* *The disputed parcel (1814 & 1818):* the text says it was *"`von der
herrschaftlichen Söhre-Weide … und vom Forstgründe angekauft`"* (bought from the
domain). In practice that usually means one of two things:
[arabic]
. *Kaufgut (freehold/allod):* the domain *sold the land out*; Krückeberg
(or his father) became *owner* of that parcel.
. *Erbpacht/Erbstand (hereditary lease sold for a price):* the domain
kept the higher title but *sold the perpetual use right*; economically
it behaves like property.
* *What the Rentkammer considered "`buying back`":* Not the colonate as
such, and not "`soil they already owned.`" They were weighing a
*Rückkauf of the specific parcel/right that had been sold in 1814/1818*
— i.e., *reacquiring what Krückeberg held* (either the freehold itself
or his perpetual use right) to generate cash to satisfy his debts to
Hempel & Söhne.
* *Why the forester advised against it:* He valued the parcel at *~½ of
what was paid in 1814*, noted *flooding/poor drainage*, and concluded a repurchase
*"`nicht im herrschaftlichen Interesse`"* (not in the lordship’s interest). In other
words, *bad asset for the domain to take back*, even if it would put cash in
Krückeberg’s hands for debt relief.

So: *"`Colon`" ≠ "`everything is leased.`"* Krückeberg could be a colonate holder
*and* own (or hold perpetually) *separately purchased parcels*. The Rentkammer’s
contemplated purchase was *of that purchased parcel/right*, not of the colonate
itself.
