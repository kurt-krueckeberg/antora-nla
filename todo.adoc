== Document Index, Definitions, Timelines and Events

* Document 1's translation is inaccurate in this section:
"On my property there already rest 700 Reichstaler of secured debts, yet
I can find no other remedy, however reluctantly I may still
increase my interest burden. I must therefore most humbly request"
+
** "rest" should be "rests", but neither is idiomatic or makes sense. Who would actually say:
"On my property there already rest 700 Reichstaler of secured debts"? Is is saying he owes 70o Rthl in addition
to the debt his father left him with?
** "however reluctantly I may still increase my interest burden" sounds incomplete. Should it be
"however relunctant I may be to increae my interest burden"?
** What does "Nrpr: 1274" at the bottom of the first page mean?

* Move the glossary in doc-index.adoc elsewhere, to a separate page?

* Create a table of "N.C." numbers "Ad N.C." numbers their document index 6-and-entry and associated dates.

* What does "O. f. Kreutziner" mean--official? I believe document 6 says he is head forester, or something like it.

* Once document 9 has been added, add xref-links to it.

=== Consoliate 

Combine The "Amt Bückeburg - Decree and Execution Order - 10/13 July 1841" with 
"Service of the Decree (Bescheid) — 27 July 1841 (re: Doc 1i, 10 July 1841)" into one page.

=== Finish Document 6

=== Finish New Overview

Finish new-overview.adoc and include in it the footnotes that are defined at the end of the page and include
xrefs to the anchors of the document's the footnote refers to.

== How Documents are Referenced: Understanding the NLA 1236 Headers

== Here’s a plain-language explanation of the three headers and how to understand them:

=== *Header 1:*

....
Cam: Nr: 662.
Res Cam
zum Forstamts Bericht.
praes: 30. May 1798.
B. 14. Jun. 1798
....

This header refers to a separate case numbered *662* in the records of
the *Cammer* (a central administrative or financial office).

* *"`Res Cam`"* means this is a response from the Cammer.
* *"`zum Forstamts Bericht`"* tells us the response was regarding a
report submitted by the *Forestry Office*.
* *"`praes: 30. May 1798`"* is the date the Forestry Office submitted
its report.
* *"`B. 14. Jun. 1798`"* shows the Cammer issued its response on June
14, 1798, in Bückeburg.

So this is a dated response to a forestry-related matter and unrelated
to the other two headers.

=== *Header 2:*

....
pr: 6. Merz 1799
Cam: N: 53.
2 1.
Forst-Sachen
....

This marks the registration of a new forestry-related case:

* *"`pr:`"* likely means "`protocolliert`" (registered) or
"`presentiert`" (presented), with the date: *March 6, 1799*.
* *"`Cam: N: 53`"* means this is *case number 53* in the Cammer’s
internal records.
* *"`2 1`"* could be an internal filing code—possibly bundle 2, document
1.
* *"`Forst-Sachen`"* simply means "`Forestry Matters,`" the category of
the issue.

This header introduces the case involving *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*
and his request to expand his property.

=== *Header 3:*

....
ad nr: Cam: 53. S. S.
Concept Cammer: Rescript
an die Beamten zu Buckeburg
....

This header is tied to the previous one—it refers to *the same case,
number 53*:

* *"`ad nr:`"* is Latin for "`concerning number`"—so this means:
"`Regarding case number Cam: 53`".
* *"`S. S.`"* is Latin for _"`supra scripta`"_—"`as written above`" or
"`see earlier.`"
* *"`Concept Cammer: Rescript`"* means this is a *draft* of a rescript
(official reply or directive) issued by the Cammer.
* *"`an die Beamten zu Bückeburg`"* shows that the directive was sent to
local officials in Bückeburg.

=== Summary:

* Header 1 (Cam: 662) is from an earlier, unrelated case in 1798.
* Headers 2 and 3 (Cam: 53) both concern the *same case* from 1799 about
Krückeberg’s petition.
* They reflect different steps in the case: first the registration of
the matter, and then the official response issued to the local Amts.
