* Volunteer for Convention
* Append 06-left-page image and text into image5 image and text.

* Make Document 2 only one page.
* The so-called left page of Document #3 is likely part of document #2.

== Only Have on AsiiDoc page per Document

Only Have on AsiiDoc page per Document. Just make the documents longer. Use scaled "overview" images at the
top of the page if there are multiple blocks or sections of text. Give an overview of these. Then logically,
in an easy-to-follow manner display each and gives its transliteration and paralell translation.

== Indexing System for Documents

IMPORTANT: The numbers in the squares in the top right corner refer to the "`Description of document/action`" in Image 1.

What is the structure of the contents of the 1236 folder. What is
documents are in it? What are they about? How are they referenced. Is
there an "`index`"?

== How Documents are Referenced: Understanding the NLA 1236 Headers

== Here’s a plain-language explanation of the three headers and how to understand them:

=== *Header 1:*

....
Cam: Nr: 662.
Res Cam
zum Forstamts Bericht.
praes: 30. May 1798.
B. 14. Jun. 1798
....

This header refers to a separate case numbered *662* in the records of
the *Cammer* (a central administrative or financial office).

* *"`Res Cam`"* means this is a response from the Cammer.
* *"`zum Forstamts Bericht`"* tells us the response was regarding a
report submitted by the *Forestry Office*.
* *"`praes: 30. May 1798`"* is the date the Forestry Office submitted
its report.
* *"`B. 14. Jun. 1798`"* shows the Cammer issued its response on June
14, 1798, in Bückeburg.

So this is a dated response to a forestry-related matter and unrelated
to the other two headers.

=== *Header 2:*

....
pr: 6. Merz 1799
Cam: N: 53.
2 1.
Forst-Sachen
....

This marks the registration of a new forestry-related case:

* *"`pr:`"* likely means "`protocolliert`" (registered) or
"`presentiert`" (presented), with the date: *March 6, 1799*.
* *"`Cam: N: 53`"* means this is *case number 53* in the Cammer’s
internal records.
* *"`2 1`"* could be an internal filing code—possibly bundle 2, document
1.
* *"`Forst-Sachen`"* simply means "`Forestry Matters,`" the category of
the issue.

This header introduces the case involving *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*
and his request to expand his property.

=== *Header 3:*

....
ad nr: Cam: 53. S. S.
Concept Cammer: Rescript
an die Beamten zu Buckeburg
....

This header is tied to the previous one—it refers to *the same case,
number 53*:

* *"`ad nr:`"* is Latin for "`concerning number`"—so this means:
"`Regarding case number Cam: 53`".
* *"`S. S.`"* is Latin for _"`supra scripta`"_—"`as written above`" or
"`see earlier.`"
* *"`Concept Cammer: Rescript`"* means this is a *draft* of a rescript
(official reply or directive) issued by the Cammer.
* *"`an die Beamten zu Bückeburg`"* shows that the directive was sent to
local officials in Bückeburg.

=== Summary:

* Header 1 (Cam: 662) is from an earlier, unrelated case in 1798.
* Headers 2 and 3 (Cam: 53) both concern the *same case* from 1799 about
Krückeberg’s petition.
* They reflect different steps in the case: first the registration of
the matter, and then the official response issued to the local Amts.
