== Meaning of Document Index No. 2 entries:

=== Column keys

* *No* – index number of the entry in this document list.
* *Acten Designation (left)* – short description of the piece
(who/what).
* *Acten Designation (right)* – filing rubric / registry note (where it’s filed or series/desk).
* *Ort* – place.
* *Jahr* – year.
* *Mon* – month.
* *Z.* – running register *Zahl* (sequential number in that month’s
register).

=== Row 1 (No *2.*)

* *Acten Designation (left):* _Bericht Amts Bückeburg_ → "`Report of the Amt (district office) of Bückeburg.`"
* *Acten Designation (right):* _Cour. aus_ (very likely *Corr.  aus[gehend]*) → "`Outgoing correspondence`"
series/rubric in the registry. (In Kurrent the double *rr* often looks like *ur*, hence _Cour._)
* *Ort:* _Bückeburg_ (place of origin/registry).
* *Jahr:* _1841_.
* *Mon:* _October_.
* *Z.:* _7_ → entry no. 7 in the October register.

=== Row 2 (No *〃* = ditto of 2)

* *Acten Designation (left):* _Gg. K Res. an dasselbe_ → *Gg.* = _Gegen_ ("`in reply to / concerning`"),
*K Res.* = _Kammer-Resolution_ ("`chamber resolution`"); 
whole phrase: "`Chamber resolution, to the same [office].`"
* *Acten Designation (right):* _Cammer-Casse_ → rubric/subject
"`Kammerkasse`" (the chamber treasury).
* *Ort:* _〃_ (ditto = Bückeburg).
* *Jahr:* _〃_ (1841).
* *Mon:* _〃_ (October).
* *Z.:* _14_ → entry no. 14 in the October register.

*How to read the pair:* together they show (a) an incoming report from the Amt Bückeburg and
(b) the Rentkammer’s resolution sent back "`to the same,`" with cross-references to the filing
rubrics ("`Outgoing correspondence`" / "`Kammerkasse`") and the register numbers (Z. 7 and Z.
14).

=== Document Index, Definitions, Timelines and Events

* Create xrefs that link the document index entries to the actual documents (and supplemental documents) and an
anchor in the doducment 
* Check the "NC" numbers for each document in the document index and create a table that lists these
numbers along with the subject and the documents they refer to.
* Creat a glossary with definitions of key terms and examples that illustrate and show the meaning.
* Ensure the accuracy of the translations
* Within the chronological story of the Rentcammer documents, related reports and its decision, create a chronology
of facts and events in Johann Heinrich Krückeberg's financial trial. 

=== Consoliate 

Combine The "Amt Bückeburg - Decree and Execution Order - 10/13 July 1841" with 
"Service of the Decree (Bescheid) — 27 July 1841 (re: Doc 1i, 10 July 1841)" into one page.

=== Finish Document 6

=== Finish New Overview

Finish new-overview.adoc and include in it the footnotes that are defined at the end of the page and include
xrefs to the anchors of the document's the footnote refers to.

== How Documents are Referenced: Understanding the NLA 1236 Headers

== Here’s a plain-language explanation of the three headers and how to understand them:

=== *Header 1:*

....
Cam: Nr: 662.
Res Cam
zum Forstamts Bericht.
praes: 30. May 1798.
B. 14. Jun. 1798
....

This header refers to a separate case numbered *662* in the records of
the *Cammer* (a central administrative or financial office).

* *"`Res Cam`"* means this is a response from the Cammer.
* *"`zum Forstamts Bericht`"* tells us the response was regarding a
report submitted by the *Forestry Office*.
* *"`praes: 30. May 1798`"* is the date the Forestry Office submitted
its report.
* *"`B. 14. Jun. 1798`"* shows the Cammer issued its response on June
14, 1798, in Bückeburg.

So this is a dated response to a forestry-related matter and unrelated
to the other two headers.

=== *Header 2:*

....
pr: 6. Merz 1799
Cam: N: 53.
2 1.
Forst-Sachen
....

This marks the registration of a new forestry-related case:

* *"`pr:`"* likely means "`protocolliert`" (registered) or
"`presentiert`" (presented), with the date: *March 6, 1799*.
* *"`Cam: N: 53`"* means this is *case number 53* in the Cammer’s
internal records.
* *"`2 1`"* could be an internal filing code—possibly bundle 2, document
1.
* *"`Forst-Sachen`"* simply means "`Forestry Matters,`" the category of
the issue.

This header introduces the case involving *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*
and his request to expand his property.

=== *Header 3:*

....
ad nr: Cam: 53. S. S.
Concept Cammer: Rescript
an die Beamten zu Buckeburg
....

This header is tied to the previous one—it refers to *the same case,
number 53*:

* *"`ad nr:`"* is Latin for "`concerning number`"—so this means:
"`Regarding case number Cam: 53`".
* *"`S. S.`"* is Latin for _"`supra scripta`"_—"`as written above`" or
"`see earlier.`"
* *"`Concept Cammer: Rescript`"* means this is a *draft* of a rescript
(official reply or directive) issued by the Cammer.
* *"`an die Beamten zu Bückeburg`"* shows that the directive was sent to
local officials in Bückeburg.

=== Summary:

* Header 1 (Cam: 662) is from an earlier, unrelated case in 1798.
* Headers 2 and 3 (Cam: 53) both concern the *same case* from 1799 about
Krückeberg’s petition.
* They reflect different steps in the case: first the registration of
the matter, and then the official response issued to the local Amts.
