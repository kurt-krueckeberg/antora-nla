== Relationship Between Document 2 and the Note on Its Reverse

The brief note on the reverse side of the sheet containing Document 2 almost certainly belongs with Document 2 and not with Document 3.
IMPORTANT: It DOES NOT appear on the reverse side of Document 2. It appears on the reserve side of a blank page.

=== Reasons for Attribution to Document 2

1. Physical Continuity::
   The note appears on the back (verso) of the same sheet that contains the main text of Document 2. In archival practice of the period, such back-side annotations were commonly used to summarize or route the document.

2. Content Alignment::
   The note reiterates the substance of Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg’s petition (“der Colon Krückeberg Nr. 10 … bittet unterthänigst …”), which is also the central topic of Document 2. It does not introduce a new subject or address a different matter.

3. Routing Function::
   The note concludes with “zur vormundschaftlichen Rentkammer”, indicating it served as a forwarding or routing instruction. This was a typical use of the back side of a document in administrative procedures of the era.

4. Absence of Separate Filing Indicators::
   The note has no new date, no distinct document number, no formal address or salutation—elements which would typically signify the start of a new document.

=== Conclusion

The note on the reverse side of Document 2 should be treated as part of Document 2. It likely served as a routing or summary annotation for internal use.

You may label it for presentation purposes as:

> Note on reverse side of Document 2 — routing summary

== Other Activities

* Volunteer for Convention
* Append 06-left-page image and text into image5 image and text.

* Break Document 1 into a landing index page and two subpages: one for the petition and its endorsement, the other for the
report.
* Make Document 2 one page--but only after determing if:
** the left page of Document #3 is likely part of document #2.
* Decide on titles for documents #5 and #6.

== Indexing System for Documents

IMPORTANT: The numbers in the squares in the top right corner refer to the "`Description of document/action`" in Image 1.

What is the structure of the contents of the 1236 folder. What is
documents are in it? What are they about? How are they referenced. Is
there an "`index`"?

== How Documents are Referenced: Understanding the NLA 1236 Headers

== Here’s a plain-language explanation of the three headers and how to understand them:

=== *Header 1:*

....
Cam: Nr: 662.
Res Cam
zum Forstamts Bericht.
praes: 30. May 1798.
B. 14. Jun. 1798
....

This header refers to a separate case numbered *662* in the records of
the *Cammer* (a central administrative or financial office).

* *"`Res Cam`"* means this is a response from the Cammer.
* *"`zum Forstamts Bericht`"* tells us the response was regarding a
report submitted by the *Forestry Office*.
* *"`praes: 30. May 1798`"* is the date the Forestry Office submitted
its report.
* *"`B. 14. Jun. 1798`"* shows the Cammer issued its response on June
14, 1798, in Bückeburg.

So this is a dated response to a forestry-related matter and unrelated
to the other two headers.

=== *Header 2:*

....
pr: 6. Merz 1799
Cam: N: 53.
2 1.
Forst-Sachen
....

This marks the registration of a new forestry-related case:

* *"`pr:`"* likely means "`protocolliert`" (registered) or
"`presentiert`" (presented), with the date: *March 6, 1799*.
* *"`Cam: N: 53`"* means this is *case number 53* in the Cammer’s
internal records.
* *"`2 1`"* could be an internal filing code—possibly bundle 2, document
1.
* *"`Forst-Sachen`"* simply means "`Forestry Matters,`" the category of
the issue.

This header introduces the case involving *Jobst Heinrich Krückeberg*
and his request to expand his property.

=== *Header 3:*

....
ad nr: Cam: 53. S. S.
Concept Cammer: Rescript
an die Beamten zu Buckeburg
....

This header is tied to the previous one—it refers to *the same case,
number 53*:

* *"`ad nr:`"* is Latin for "`concerning number`"—so this means:
"`Regarding case number Cam: 53`".
* *"`S. S.`"* is Latin for _"`supra scripta`"_—"`as written above`" or
"`see earlier.`"
* *"`Concept Cammer: Rescript`"* means this is a *draft* of a rescript
(official reply or directive) issued by the Cammer.
* *"`an die Beamten zu Bückeburg`"* shows that the directive was sent to
local officials in Bückeburg.

=== Summary:

* Header 1 (Cam: 662) is from an earlier, unrelated case in 1798.
* Headers 2 and 3 (Cam: 53) both concern the *same case* from 1799 about
Krückeberg’s petition.
* They reflect different steps in the case: first the registration of
the matter, and then the official response issued to the local Amts.
